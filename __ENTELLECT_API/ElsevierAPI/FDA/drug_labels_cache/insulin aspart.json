      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Inspect visually before use. Appearance should be uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm (2.1). \u2022 Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (2.1) . \u2022 Do not administer intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack) (2.2) . \u2022 Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, glycemic control goal ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.2 ). \u2022 When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 may be needed ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions \u2022 Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . \u2022 Inspect Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) visually before use. It should appear uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. \u2022 When using the: o Vial, roll the vial gently in hands in a horizontal position 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. o Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen, roll Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen gently between hands in a horizontal position 10 times. Then, turn Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. \u2022 The Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen dials in 1-unit increments. \u2022 Use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. \u2022 Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. \u2022 Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . \u2022 Do not administer Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps. \u2022 Do not mix Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with any other insulins. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack). \u2022 Individualize the dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. \u2022 When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Dosage modification may be needed when Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is used concomitantly with certain drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share a Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) . \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2) . \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3) . \u2022 Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection (5.4) . \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, treat, and monitor, if indicated (5.5) . \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6) . \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) . 5.1 Never Share Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) FlexPen should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in: \u2022 Table 1 reflects the exposure of 55 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 43 years old. Sixty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. \u2022 Table 2 reflects the exposure of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 63 years old. Fifty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse reactions that occurred for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart-treated patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=55) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 38 69 Headache 19 35 Influenza-like symptoms 7 13 Dyspepsia 5 9 Back pain 4 7 Diarrhea 4 7 Pharyngitis 4 7 Rhinitis 3 5 Skeletal pain 3 5 Upper respiratory tract infection 3 5 Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=85) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 40 47 Upper respiratory tract infection 10 12 Headache 8 9 Diarrhea 7 8 Neuropathy 7 8 Pharyngitis 5 6 Abdominal pain 4 5 Rhinitis 4 5 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was 16% and 4% for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients respectively at 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Allergic Reactions Patients have experienced reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, have required discontinuation of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 3-month study with an extension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, 100% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study including 91.4% that were positive at baseline. A total of 91.4% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study, including 62.1% that were positive at baseline. In a type 2 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin followed by a decrease approaching to baseline values was observed in Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart and Novolin 70/30 treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have been reported. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have not been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger adult patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise, may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart is a human insulin analog containing 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals and 30% soluble insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 O 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is a uniform, white and cloudy, sterile injectable suspension for subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerol (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), protamine sulfate (0.32 mg), sodium chloride (0.877 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 has a pH of 7.20 - 7.44. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Molecular chain of insulin aspart."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A euglycemic clamp study described below assessed glucose utilization after subcutaneous dosing of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects (n = 24). Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes and the mean \u00b1 SD time to peak activity is 2.7 hr \u00b1 0.9 hr. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart reduces the molecule\u2019s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of insulin aspart are maintained by Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart compared to insulin aspart indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C max ) of 61.3 \u00b1 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (see Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profile). Figure 3.

Patients had received insulin for at least 24 months before the study. Oral hypoglycemic agents were not allowed within 1 month prior to the study or during the study. The small changes in HbA 1c were comparable across the treatment groups (see Table 4). For patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the mean age was 43 years old, 64% were male, 100% were White, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 , and mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 15 years.

The mean age of the trial population was 53 years old and mean duration of diabetes was 9.2 years. Forty-six percent were male. Eighty-five percent were White, 12% were Black and 3% were Asian. The mean BMI was approximately 32.4 kg/m 2 . During an 8-week optimization period metformin and pioglitazone were increased to 2500 mg per day and 30 or 45 mg per day, respectively. After the optimization period, patients were randomized to receive either Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart twice daily added on to the metformin and pioglitazone regimen or continue the current optimized metformin and pioglitazone therapy. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was started at a dose of 6 international units twice daily (before breakfast and before supper). Insulin doses were titrated to a pre-meal glucose goal of 80-110 mg/dL. The total daily insulin dose at the end of the study was 56.9 \u00b1 30.5 international units.

Trial 2: In a 28-week, open-label trial (Trial 2), insulin-na\u00efve patients with type 2 diabetes with fasting plasma glucose above 140 mg/dL currently treated with metformin \u00b1 thiazolidinedione therapy were randomized to receive either Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart twice daily [before breakfast and before supper] or insulin glargine once daily (see Table 6). Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was started at an average dose of 5-6 international units (0.07 \u00b1 0.03 international units/kg) twice daily (before breakfast and before supper), and bedtime insulin glargine was started at 10-12 international units (0.13 \u00b1 0.03 international units/kg). Insulin doses were titrated weekly by decrements or increments of -2 to +6 units per injection to a pre-meal glucose goal of 80-110 mg/dL. The metformin dose was adjusted to 2,550 mg/day. Approximately one-third of the patients in each group were also treated with pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Insulin secretagogues were discontinued in order to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Most patients were White (53%), and the mean initial weight was 90 kg. The mean age of the trial population was 53 years old and mean duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Fifty three percent were male. Fifty-five percent were White, 15% Black, 27% were Hispanic, 2% were Asian and 2% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 31.5 kg/m 2 .

Supplies you will need to give your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 injection: \u2022 10 mL Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vial \u2022 insulin syringe and needle \u2022 alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 dose: \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Before you start to prepare your injection, check the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should look white and cloudy after mixing. Do not use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 if it looks clear or contains any lumps or particles. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is easier to mix when it is at room temperature. \u2022 After mixing Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, inject your dose right away. If you wait to inject your dose, the insulin will need to be mixed again. \u2022 Do not use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 past the expiration date printed on the label. Step 1: If you are using a new vial, pull off the tamper-resistant cap (See Figure A). Step 2: Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure B). Step 3: Roll the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vial between your hands 10 times. Keep the vial in a horizontal (flat) position (See Figure C). Roll the vial between your hands until the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 looks white and cloudy. Do not shake the vial. Step 4: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (See Figure D). Step 5: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vial (See Figure E). Step 6: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vial (See Figure F). Step 7: Turn the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (See Figure G). \u2022 If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (See Figure H). Step 8: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 dose (See Figure I). Step 9: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30. Step 10: Pull the syringe out of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper (See Figure J). Giving your injection: \u2022 Inject your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs, or upper arms. \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Step 11: Choose your injection site and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose (See Figure K). Step 12: Insert the needle into your skin. Push down on the plunger to inject your dose (See Figure L). The needle should remain in the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the insulin. Step 13: Pull the needle out of your skin. After that, you may see a drop of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 at the needle tip. This is normal and does not affect the dose you just received (See Figure M). \u2022 If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After your injection: \u2022 Do not recap the needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. \u2022 Put the empty insulin vials, used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. How should I store Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30. Do not use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 away from heat or light. All unopened vials: \u2022 Store unopened Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vials in the refrigerator at 36 \u00b0 F to 46 \u00b0 F (2 \u00b0 C to 8 \u00b0 C). \u2022 Unopened vials may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if they have been stored in the refrigerator. \u2022 Unopened vials should be thrown away after 28 days, if they are stored at room temperature. After vials have been opened: \u2022 Opened Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vials can be stored in the refrigerator 36 \u00b0 F to 46 \u00b0 F (2 \u00b0 C to 8 \u00b0 C) or at room temperature below 86 \u00b0 F (30 \u00b0 C) for up to 28 days. \u2022 Throw away all opened Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vials after 28 days, even if they still have insulin left in them. General information about the safe and effective use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 \u2022 Always use a new syringe and needle for each injection. \u2022 Do not share syringes or needles. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 vials, syringes, and needles out of the reach of children.

Manufactured by: Novo Nordisk Inc. 800 Scudders Mill Road Plainsboro, NJ 08536 U.S. License Number 1261 Revised: 02/2023 PATENT Information: http://novonordisk-us.com/products/product-patents.html \u00a9 2023 Novo Nordisk For information contact: Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. 1-800-727-6500 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use FlexPen \u00ae This product is Novolog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart). Read the following instructions carefully before you start using your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. You should read the instructions even if you have used Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen before. Do not share your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen is a disposable, single-patient-use dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needles. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen without help from a person trained to use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen . Getting ready Make sure you have the following items: \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen \u2022 New NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needle \u2022 Alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should look cloudy after mixing. Before your first injection with a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen you must mix the insulin: A. Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix. Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A). B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (see diagram B). C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position 1 and 2 as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other (see diagram C). Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles. For every following injection move the pen up and down between positions 1 and 2 at least ten times until the liquid appears white and cloudy. After mixing, complete all the following steps of the injection right away. If there is a delay, the insulin will need to be mixed again. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Before you inject, there must be at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to make sure the remaining insulin is evenly mixed. If there are less than 12 units left, use a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen. Attaching the needle D. Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle. Screw the needle tightly onto your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram D). Never place a disposable needle on your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection. E. Pull off the big outer needle cap (see diagram E). F. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram F). \u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles or syringes with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u2022 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \u2022 To reduce the risk of a needle stick, never put the inner needle cap back on the needle. Giving the airshot before each injection Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to make sure you take the right dose of insulin : G. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram G). H. Hold your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram H). I. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram I). The dose selector returns to 0. A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times. If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500. A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Selecting your dose Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0. J. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose. The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram J). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out. You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u2022 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection \u2022 Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. K. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram K). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. L. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram L). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. \u2022 Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap and throw it away in a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. \u2022 When there is not enough medicine left in your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen for your prescribed dose, the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. The Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied. It is designed to deliver 300 units. M. Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram M). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Inspect visually before use. Appearance should be uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles ( 2.1 ). Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature ( 2.1 ). Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm (2.1). Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation ( 2.1 ). Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (2.1) . Do not administer intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps ( 2.1 ). Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack) (2.2) . Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, glycemic control goal ( 2.2 ). Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.2 ). When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 may be needed ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Inspect Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) visually before use. It should appear uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. When using the: Vial, roll the vial gently in hands in a horizontal position 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen, roll Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen gently between hands in a horizontal position 10 times. Then, turn Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. The Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen dials in 1-unit increments. Use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation. Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . Do not administer Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps. Do not mix Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with any other insulins. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack). Individualize the dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) . Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2) . Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3) . Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection (5.4) . Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, treat, and monitor, if indicated (5.5) . Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6) . Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) . 5.1 Never Share Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) FlexPen should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in: Table 1 reflects the exposure of 55 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 43 years old. Sixty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Table 2 reflects the exposure of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 63 years old. Fifty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse reactions that occurred for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart-treated patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=55) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 38 69 Headache 19 35 Influenza-like symptoms 7 13 Dyspepsia 5 9 Back pain 4 7 Diarrhea 4 7 Pharyngitis 4 7 Rhinitis 3 5 Skeletal pain 3 5 Upper respiratory tract infection 3 5 Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=85) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 40 47 Upper respiratory tract infection 10 12 Headache 8 9 Diarrhea 7 8 Neuropathy 7 8 Pharyngitis 5 6 Abdominal pain 4 5 Rhinitis 4 5 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was 16% and 4% for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients respectively at 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Allergic Reactions Patients have experienced reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, have required discontinuation of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 3-month study with an extension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, 100% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study including 91.4% that were positive at baseline. A total of 91.4% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study, including 62.1% that were positive at baseline. In a type 2 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin followed by a decrease approaching to baseline values was observed in Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart and Novolin 70/30 treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have been reported. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have not been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger adult patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise, may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart is a human insulin analog containing 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals and 30% soluble insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 O 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is a uniform, white and cloudy, sterile injectable suspension for subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerol (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), protamine sulfate (0.32 mg), sodium chloride (0.877 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 has a pH of 7.20 - 7.44. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A euglycemic clamp study described below assessed glucose utilization after subcutaneous dosing of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects (n = 24). Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes and the mean \u00b1 SD time to peak activity is 2.7 hr \u00b1 0.9 hr. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours. . Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart reduces the molecule\u2019s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of insulin aspart are maintained by Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart compared to insulin aspart indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C max ) of 61.3 \u00b1 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart . Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Distribution and Elimination Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin."

Patients had received insulin for at least 24 months before the study. Oral hypoglycemic agents were not allowed within 1 month prior to the study or during the study. The small changes in HbA 1c were comparable across the treatment groups (see Table 4). For patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the mean age was 43 years old, 64% were male, 100% were White, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 , and mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 15 years.

This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use FlexPen \u00ae This product is Novolog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart). Read the following instructions carefully before you start using your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. You should read the instructions even if you have used Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen before. Do not share your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen is a disposable, single-patient-use dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needles. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen without help from a person trained to use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen . Getting ready Make sure you have the following items: Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen New NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needle Alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should look cloudy after mixing. Before your first injection with a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen you must mix the insulin: A. Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix. Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A). B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal. C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position 1 and 2 as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other. Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles. For every following injection move the pen up and down between positions 1 and 2 at least ten times until the liquid appears white and cloudy. After mixing, complete all the following steps of the injection right away. If there is a delay, the insulin will need to be mixed again. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Before you inject, there must be at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to make sure the remaining insulin is evenly mixed. If there are less than 12 units left, use a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen. Attaching the needle D. Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle. Screw the needle tightly onto your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram D). Never place a disposable needle on your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection. E. Pull off the big outer needle cap. F. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it). Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles or syringes with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. To reduce the risk of a needle stick, never put the inner needle cap back on the needle. Giving the airshot before each injection Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to make sure you take the right dose of insulin : G. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. H. Hold your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. I. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times. If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500. A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Selecting your dose Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0. J. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose. The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram J). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out. You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. K. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram K). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. L. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram L). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap and throw it away in a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. When there is not enough medicine left in your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen for your prescribed dose, the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. The Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied. It is designed to deliver 300 units. M. Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram M). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen. How should I store Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen?

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See Full Prescribing Information for important preparation, administration, and dosage instructions ( 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 ). Subcutaneous injection ( 2.2 ): Inject subcutaneously within 5-10 minutes before a meal into the abdominal area, thigh, buttocks or upper arm. Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Should generally be used in regimens with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin. Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump) ( 2.2 ): Refer to the insulin infusion pump user manual to see if NovoLog (insulin aspart) can be used. Use in accordance with the insulin pump instructions for use. Administer by continuous subcutaneous infusion using an insulin pump in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. Rotate the injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not mix with other insulins or diluents in the pump. Intravenous Administration ( 2.2 ) : Dilute Insulin Aspart to concentrations from 0.05 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. Insulin Aspart is stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Aspart based on route of administration, the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal ( 2.4 ). Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.4 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is NovoLog (insulin aspart) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Inspect Insulin Aspart visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if particulate matter or coloration is seen. In patients with visual impairment, use: Insulin Aspart FlexPen with caution in those who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. PenFill cartridges with caution. Do not mix Insulin Aspart with other insulins when administering using a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump. 2.2 Preparation and Administration Instructions for the Approved Routes of Administration Subcutaneous Injection Inject Insulin Aspart subcutaneously within 5-10 minutes before a meal into the abdominal area, thigh, buttocks or upper arm. Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Dial the Insulin Aspart FlexPen dials in 1-unit increments. Generally use Insulin Aspart (administered by subcutaneous injection) in regimens with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin. May dilute this Insulin Aspart product with Insulin Diluting Medium for NovoLog for subcutaneous injection. Diluting one part Insulin Aspart to: Nine parts diluent will yield a concentration one-tenth that of Insulin Aspart (equivalent to U-10). One part diluent will yield a concentration one-half that of Insulin Aspart (equivalent to U-50). Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump) Can use this Insulin Aspart product with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart). Refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Use Insulin Aspart in accordance with the insulin pump system\u2019s instructions for use. Train patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. Administer Insulin Aspart by continuous subcutaneous infusion in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. Rotate infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]. Instruct patients to follow healthcare provider recommendations when setting basal and meal time infusion rate. Change the Insulin Aspart in the reservoir at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter. Follow the NovoLog-specific information for in-use time because NovoLog-specific information may differ from general pump manual instructions. Change the infusion set and the infusion set insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Aspart when administering by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Do not expose Insulin Aspart in the pump reservoir to temperatures greater than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). Intravenous Administration Administer Insulin Aspart intravenously only under medical supervision with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)]. Dilute Insulin Aspart to concentrations from 0.05 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. Insulin Aspart is stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations Individualize the dosage of Insulin Aspart based on the route of administration, the patient\u2019s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Dosage modification may be needed when Insulin Aspart is used concomitantly with certain drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 2.5 Instructions for Mixing Insulin Aspart with Other Insulins The table below includes instructions regarding mixing Insulin Aspart with other insulins. Subcutaneous injection route Insulin Aspart may only be mixed with NPH insulin preparations. \u2022 If Insulin Aspart is mixed with NPH insulin, withdraw Insulin Aspart into the syringe first and inject immediately after mixing.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge device between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.1 ). Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring ( 5.2 ). Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness ( 5. 3). Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection ( 5. 4). Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart, treat, and monitor, if indicated ( 5.5 ). Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated ( 5. 6). Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs ( 5.7 ). Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer Insulin Aspart by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Never Share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered. 5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Insulin Aspart may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with Insulin Aspart include: hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of Insulin Aspart was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 39 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 7.9%. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 57 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 8.1%. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Table 1: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 596) Regular Human Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 286) Headache 12 10 Injury accidental 11 10 Nausea 7 5 Diarrhea 5 3 Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 91) Human Regular Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 91) Hyporeflexia 11 7 Onychomycosis 10 5 Sensory disturbance 9 7 Urinary tract infection 8 7 Chest pain 5 3 Headache 5 3 Skin disorder 5 2 Abdominal pain 5 1 Sinusitis 5 1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart . The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in: Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 10% at 24 weeks. Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who received Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin, including Insulin Aspart have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, subcutaneously and via subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including Insulin Aspart and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 6-month study with a 6-month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline. In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric: Has not been studied in children with type 2 diabetes. Has not been studied in children with type 1 diabetes <2 years of age (8.4). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a periconceptional HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a periconceptional HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart to improve glycemic control have been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Use of Insulin Aspart for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 283 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 6 to 18 years and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients (n=1,375) treated with Insulin Aspart in 3 controlled clinical studies, 2.6% (n=36) were 65 years of age or over. One-half of these patients had type 1 diabetes (18/1285) and the other half had type 2 diabetes (18/90). The HbA 1c response to Insulin Aspart, as compared to regular human insulin, did not differ by age. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.6 )] . Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting human insulin analog homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 0 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Insulin Aspart injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution for subcutaneous or intravenous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerin (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), sodium chloride (0.58 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart has a pH of 7.2-7.6. Hydrochloric acid 10% and/or sodium hydroxide 10% may be added to adjust pH."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Standard 2-year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Insulin Aspart. In 52-week studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with Insulin Aspart at 10, 50, and 200 units/kg/day (approximately 2, 8, and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 units/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively). At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, Insulin Aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Insulin Aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, and in ex vivo UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes. In fertility studies in male and female rats, at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area), no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or general reproductive performance of animals was observed. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in mice and rabbits, one unit of Insulin Aspart has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous Insulin Aspart were compared to regular human insulin in 596 type 1 diabetes adult, 187 pediatric type 1 diabetes, and 91 adult type 2 diabetes patients using NPH as basal insulin (see Tables 3, 4, 5). The reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) was similar to regular human insulin. The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by external pump were compared to buffered regular human insulin (administered by CSII), to lispro (administered by CSII) and compared to Insulin Aspart injections and NPH injection. Overall, the reduction in HbA 1c was similar to the comparator. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes with Subcutaneous Injections Type 1 Diabetes \u2013 Adults (see Table 3) Two 24-week, open\u2011label, active-controlled studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart to regular human insulin injection in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Because the two study designs and results were similar, data are shown for only one study (see Table 3). The mean age of the trial population was 39 years and mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years. Fifty-one percent were male. Ninety-four percent were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . Insulin Aspart was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and regular human insulin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes before meals. NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin in either single or divided daily doses. Changes in HbA 1c were comparable for the two treatment regimens in this study (Table 3). Table 3.

This 24-week, parallel-group study of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=283), aged 6 to 18 years, compared two subcutaneous multiple-dose treatment regimens: Insulin Aspart (n=187) or regular human insulin (n=96). NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin. Similar effects on HbA 1c were observed in both treatment groups (Table 4). Subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin have also been compared in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=26) aged 2 to 6 years with similar effects on HbA 1c .

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Never Share an Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Advise patients that they must never share Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge devices with another person even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Advise patients using Insulin Aspart vials not to share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Instruct patients on self-management procedures including glucose monitoring, proper injection technique, and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, especially at initiation of Insulin Aspart therapy. Instruct patients on handling of special situations such as intercurrent conditions (illness, stress, or emotional disturbances), an inadequate or skipped insulin dose, inadvertent administration of an increased insulin dose, inadequate food intake, and skipped meals. Instruct patients on the management of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Inform patients that their ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery. Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypoglycemia with Medication Errors Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between insulin products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with Insulin Aspart. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Patients Using Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Pumps Train patients in both intensive insulin therapy with multiple injections and in the function of their pump and pump accessories. This Insulin Aspart product can be used with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NOVOLOG (insulin aspart) - refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NOVOLOG can be used. See recommended infusion sets in the insulin pump user manual. Instruct patients to replace insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days or according to the user manual, whichever is shorter, infusion sets and infusion set insertion sites should be changed in according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. By following this schedule, patients avoid insulin degredation, infusion set occlusion, and loss of the insulin preservative. Instruct patients to discard insulin exposed to temperatures higher than 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Instruct patients to inform physician and select a new site for infusion if infusion site becomes erythematous, pruritic, or thickened. Instruct patients of the risk of rapid hyperglycemia and ketosis due to pump malfunction, infusion set occlusion, leakage, disconnection or kinking, and degraded insulin.

Read this Instructions for Use before you start taking Insulin Aspart and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Supplies you will need to give your Insulin Aspart injection: 10 mL Insulin Aspart vial insulin syringe and needle alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart dose: Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the Insulin Aspart label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it is thick, cloudy, or is colored. Do not use Insulin Aspart past the expiration date printed on the label. Step 1: Pull off the tamper resistant cap (See Figure A). Step 2: Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure B). Step 3: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (See Figure C). Step 4: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure D). Step 5: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure E). Step 6: Turn the Insulin Aspart vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (See Figure F). If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (See Figure G). Step 7: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Insulin Aspart dose (See Figure H). Step 8: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Insulin Aspart. Step 9: Pull the syringe out of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper (See Figure I). Giving your Injection: Inject your Insulin Aspart exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms, infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump), or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider. If you inject Insulin Aspart, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, you should change your infusion set and insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. This Insulin Aspart product can be used with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart) - refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Insulin Aspart should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites. Do not insert into the exact same spot for each insertion. Do not insert where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not insert where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. The insulin in the reservoir should be changed at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter, even if you have not used all of the insulin. If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, see your insulin pump manual for instructions or talk to your healthcare provider. NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with Insulin Aspart. Do not mix Insulin Aspart with any other type of insulin. Insulin Aspart should only be mixed with NPH insulin if it is going to be injected right away under your skin (subcutaneously). Insulin Aspart should be drawn up into the syringe before you draw up your NPH insulin. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are not sure about the right way to mix Insulin Aspart and NPH insulin. Step 10: Choose your injection site (stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms) and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose (See Figure J). (Figure J) Step 11: Insert the needle into your skin. Push down on the plunger to inject your dose (See Figure K). The needle should remain in the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the insulin. Step 12: Pull the needle out of your skin. After that, you may see a drop of Insulin Aspart at the needle tip. This is normal and does not affect the dose you just received (See Figure L). If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After your injection: Do not recap the needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. Put the empty insulin vials, used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes and needles in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container.

You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. I. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram I). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. J. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram J). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge device between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness ( 5. 3). \u2022 Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection ( 5. 4). \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart, treat, and monitor, if indicated ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated ( 5. 6). \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer Insulin Aspart by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Never Share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered. 5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Insulin Aspart may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with Insulin Aspart include: hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of Insulin Aspart was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 39 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 7.9%. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 57 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 8.1%. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Table 1: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 596) Regular Human Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 286) Headache 12 10 Injury accidental 11 10 Nausea 7 5 Diarrhea 5 3 Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 91) Human Regular Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 91) Hyporeflexia 11 7 Onychomycosis 10 5 Sensory disturbance 9 7 Urinary tract infection 8 7 Chest pain 5 3 Headache 5 3 Skin disorder 5 2 Abdominal pain 5 1 Sinusitis 5 1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart . The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in: \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . \u2022 Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 10% at 24 weeks. \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who received Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin, including Insulin Aspart have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, subcutaneously and via subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including Insulin Aspart and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 6-month study with a 6-month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline. In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric: Has not been studied in children with type 2 diabetes. Has not been studied in children with type 1 diabetes <2 years of age (8.4). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a periconceptional HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a periconceptional HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart to improve glycemic control have been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Use of Insulin Aspart for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 283 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 6 to 18 years and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients (n=1,375) treated with Insulin Aspart in 3 controlled clinical studies, 2.6% (n=36) were 65 years of age or over. One-half of these patients had type 1 diabetes (18/1285) and the other half had type 2 diabetes (18/90). The HbA 1c response to Insulin Aspart, as compared to regular human insulin, did not differ by age. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting human insulin analog homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 0 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart. Insulin Aspart injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution for subcutaneous or intravenous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerin (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), sodium chloride (0.58 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart has a pH of 7.2-7.6. Hydrochloric acid 10% and/or sodium hydroxide 10% may be added to adjust pH. Molecular Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Subcutaneous Administration The pharmacodynamic profile of Insulin Aspart given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of Insulin Aspart occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for Insulin Aspart is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as Insulin Aspart may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of Insulin Aspart activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. Insulin Aspart or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mean blood glucose profiles following intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart (hatched curve) and regular human insulin (solid curve) in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. R represents the time of autonomic reaction. Figure 1 Figure 3 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of Insulin Aspart in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either Insulin Aspart or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the Insulin Aspart group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), Insulin Aspart was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of Insulin Aspart were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of Insulin Aspart was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of Insulin Aspart. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any Insulin Aspart pharmacokinetic parameter. Figure 4"

The parameters of Insulin Aspart activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. Insulin Aspart or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of Insulin Aspart in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either Insulin Aspart or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the Insulin Aspart group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), Insulin Aspart was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of Insulin Aspart were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of Insulin Aspart was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of Insulin Aspart. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any Insulin Aspart pharmacokinetic parameter. Figure 4"

In 52-week studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with Insulin Aspart at 10, 50, and 200 units/kg/day (approximately 2, 8, and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 units/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively). At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, Insulin Aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Insulin Aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, and in ex vivo UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes. In fertility studies in male and female rats, at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area), no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or general reproductive performance of animals was observed. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in mice and rabbits, one unit of Insulin Aspart has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous Insulin Aspart were compared to regular human insulin in 596 type 1 diabetes adult, 187 pediatric type 1 diabetes, and 91 adult type 2 diabetes patients using NPH as basal insulin (see Tables 3, 4, 5). The reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) was similar to regular human insulin. The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by external pump were compared to buffered regular human insulin (administered by CSII), to lispro (administered by CSII) and compared to Insulin Aspart injections and NPH injection. Overall, the reduction in HbA 1c was similar to the comparator. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes with Subcutaneous Injections Type 1 Diabetes \u2013 Adults (see Table 3) Two 24-week, open\u2011label, active-controlled studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart to regular human insulin injection in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Because the two study designs and results were similar, data are shown for only one study (see Table 3). The mean age of the trial population was 39 years and mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years. Fifty-one percent were male. Ninety-four percent were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . Insulin Aspart was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and regular human insulin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes before meals. NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin in either single or divided daily doses. Changes in HbA 1c were comparable for the two treatment regimens in this study (Table 3). Table 3.

This 24-week, parallel-group study of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=283), aged 6 to 18 years, compared two subcutaneous multiple-dose treatment regimens: Insulin Aspart (n=187) or regular human insulin (n=96). NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin. Similar effects on HbA 1c were observed in both treatment groups (Table 4). Subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin have also been compared in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=26) aged 2 to 6 years with similar effects on HbA 1c .

Revised: 02/2023 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Aspart [in\u2219suh\u2219luhn a\u2219sprt] injection, for subcutaneous or intravenous use 10 mL multiple-dose vial (100 units/mL, U-100) This product is NovoLog (insulin aspart). Read this Instructions for Use before you start taking Insulin Aspart and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Supplies you will need to give your Insulin Aspart injection: \u2022 10 mL Insulin Aspart vial \u2022 insulin syringe and needle \u2022 alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart dose: \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Before you start to prepare your injection, check the Insulin Aspart label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it is thick, cloudy, or is colored. \u2022 Do not use Insulin Aspart past the expiration date printed on the label. Step 1: Pull off the tamper resistant cap (See Figure A). Step 2: Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure B). Step 3: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (See Figure C). Step 4: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure D). Step 5: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure E). Step 6: Turn the Insulin Aspart vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (See Figure F). \u2022 If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (See Figure G). Step 7: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Insulin Aspart dose (See Figure H). Step 8: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Insulin Aspart. Step 9: Pull the syringe out of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper (See Figure I). Giving your Injection: \u2022 Inject your Insulin Aspart exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. \u2022 Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms, infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump), or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider. \u2022 If you inject Insulin Aspart, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. \u2022 If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, you should change your infusion set and insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. This Insulin Aspart product can be used with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart) - refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Insulin Aspart should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites. Do not insert into the exact same spot for each insertion. Do not insert where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not insert where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. The insulin in the reservoir should be changed at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter, even if you have not used all of the insulin. \u2022 If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, see your insulin pump manual for instructions or talk to your healthcare provider. \u2022 NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with Insulin Aspart. Do not mix Insulin Aspart with any other type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart should only be mixed with NPH insulin if it is going to be injected right away under your skin (subcutaneously). \u2022 Insulin Aspart should be drawn up into the syringe before you draw up your NPH insulin. \u2022 Talk to your healthcare provider if you are not sure about the right way to mix Insulin Aspart and NPH insulin. Step 10: Choose your injection site (stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms) and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose (See Figure J). (Figure J) Step 11: Insert the needle into your skin. Push down on the plunger to inject your dose (See Figure K). The needle should remain in the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the insulin. Step 12: Pull the needle out of your skin. After that, you may see a drop of Insulin Aspart at the needle tip. This is normal and does not affect the dose you just received (See Figure L). \u2022 If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After your injection: \u2022 Do not recap the needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. \u2022 Put the empty insulin vials, used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes and needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal .

Check that the Insulin Aspart cartridge: o is not damaged, for example cracked or leaking o is not loose on the threaded end \u2022 Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it is cloudy or colored or if the threaded end is loose (See Figure B). (Figure B) Step 1: \u2022 Insert a 3 mL cartridge with the threaded end first into your Novo Nordisk 3 mL PenFill cartridge compatible insulin delivery device (See Figure C). \u2022 If you drop your device, check the insulin cartridge for damage such as cracks or leaking. If your cartridge is damaged, throw it away and use a new one. (Figure C) Prepare your device with a new needle Step 2: \u2022 Take a new needle, and tear off the paper tab. Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not attach a new needle to your device until you are ready to give your injection. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. You may give others a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them . \u2022 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before you use it. \u2022 Push the needle straight onto the device. Turn the needle clockwise until it is on tight (See Figure D). (Figure D) Step 3: \u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap (See Figure E) . Do not throw it away. You will need it after the injection to safely remove the needle. (Figure E) Step 4: \u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (See Figure F). Do not try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. (Figure F) A drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the insulin flow. Check the insulin flow Step 5: \u2022 Small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. You must do an airshot before each injection to avoid injecting air and to make sure you receive the prescribed dose of your medicine. \u2022 Do the airshot as described in the instruction manual that comes with your device. \u2022 Keep testing your Novo Nordisk 3 mL PenFill cartridge compatible insulin delivery device until you see insulin at the needle tip. If you still do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, change the needle and repeat this step. This makes sure that any air bubbles are removed and that insulin is getting through the needle (See Figure G). (Figure G) Select your dose Step 6: \u2022 Check to make sure that the dose counter is set to 0. \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you need to inject (See Figure H). The pointer should line up with your dose. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the dose button as insulin will come out. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u2022 Refer to your insulin delivery device manual if necessary. (Figure H) Inject your dose Step 7: \u2022 Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. \u2022 Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms (See Figure I). (Figure I) \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. \u2022 Clean your injection site with an alcohol swab. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this area again before injecting . \u2022 Insert the needle into your skin. Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows \u201c0\u201d. Continue to keep the dose button pressed and keep the needle in your skin and slowly count to 6 (see Figure J) . \u2022 Remove the needle from your skin. (Figure J) You may see a drop of Insulin Aspart at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a cotton gauze and cover with an adhesive bandage, if necessary. Do not rub the area. After your injection Step 8: \u2022 Lay your outer needle cap on a flat surface. Carefully, lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap without touching the needle (See Figure K) and push the outer needle cap completely on. (Figure K) \u2022 Hold the black cartridge holder on the insulin delivery device and unscrew the needle counterclockwise (See Figure L). (Figure L) \u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the needle in an FDA-cleared sharps container as your healthcare professional has instructed you. \u2022 Put your empty Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridge and used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and PenFill cartridges in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, and o leak-resistant and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles or syringes with other people. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Step 9: \u2022 Keep the 3 mL PenFill cartridge in the device. Do not store your device with a needle attached. This will prevent infection or leakage of insulin and will make sure that you receive the right dose of Insulin Aspart. \u2022 Put the pen cap on your device after each use to protect the insulin from light (See Figure M). (Figure M) How should I store my Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridge? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart away from heat or light. \u2022 Store the Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridge without the needle attached. Before use: \u2022 Store unused Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridges in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Unused PenFill cartridges may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if kept in the refrigerator. \u2022 If Insulin Aspart is stored mistakenly outside of refrigeration between 47\u00b0F (9\u00b0C) to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) prior to first use, it should be used within 28 days or thrown away. PenFill cartridges in use: \u2022 Store the PenFill cartridge you are currently using in the insulin delivery device at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. Do not refrigerate. \u2022 The Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridge you are using should be thrown away after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. General Information about the safe and effective use of Insulin Aspart. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridges and needles out of the reach of children. \u2022 Do not share Insulin Aspart PenFill cartridges or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u2022 Always carry extra insulin of the same type(s) you use in case of loss or damage. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u00a9 2023 Novo Nordisk Manufactured by: Novo Nordisk Inc. 800 Scudders Mill Road Plainsboro, NJ 08536 U.S. License Number 1261 Revised: 02/2023 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Aspart [in\u2219suh\u2219luhn a\u2219sprt] injection, for subcutaneous or intravenous use 3 mL FlexPen \u00ae prefilled pen (100 units/mL, U-100) This product is NovoLog (insulin aspart). Introduction Please read the following instructions carefully before using your Insulin Aspart FlexPen. Do not share your Insulin Aspart FlexPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Insulin Aspart FlexPen is a disposable, single-patient-use, dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulin Aspart FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needles. \u0394 People who are blind or have vision problems should not use this Pen without help from a person trained to use the Pen. Getting ready Make sure you have the following items: \u2022 Insulin Aspart FlexPen \u2022 New NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needle \u2022 Alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart FlexPen Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use your Insulin Aspart FlexPen if the liquid contains particles or is colored. A . Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A). Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. B. Attaching the needle Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle. Screw the needle tightly onto your FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram B). Never place a disposable needle on your Insulin Aspart FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection. C. Pull off the big outer needle cap (see diagram C). D. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram D). \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u0394 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \u0394 To reduce the risk of unexpected needle sticks, never put the inner needle cap back on the needle. Giving the airshot before each injection Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to ensure proper dosing: E. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram E). F. Hold your Insulin Aspart FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram F). G. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram G). The dose selector returns to 0. A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times. If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500. A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Selecting your dose Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0. H. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose. The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram H). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out. You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. I. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram I). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. J. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram J). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. If you do not have a sharps container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap. Safely remove the needle and throw it away as soon as you can. \u2022 The used Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. \u2022 Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. \u2022 When there is not enough medicine left in your Insulin Aspart FlexPen for your prescribed dose, the Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. The Insulin Aspart FlexPen prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied. It is designed to deliver 300 units. K . Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram K). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen. How should I store Insulin Aspart FlexPen? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart away from heat or light. \u2022 Store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached. \u2022 Until first use: o Store unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). o Unused FlexPen may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if kept in the refrigerator. o Unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen stored at room temperature should be thrown away after 28 days. \u2022 In-use: o Store the FlexPen you are currently using out of the refrigerator at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. o The Insulin Aspart FlexPen you are using should be thrown away after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Maintenance For the safe and proper use of your FlexPen be sure to handle it with care. Avoid dropping your FlexPen as it may damage it. If you are concerned that your FlexPen is damaged, use a new one. You can clean the outside of your FlexPen by wiping it with a damp cloth. Do not soak or wash your FlexPen as it may damage it. Do not refill your FlexPen. \u0394 Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection. This helps to ensure sterility, prevent leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin for future injections. \u0394 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle sticks and transfer of infectious diseases. \u0394 Keep your Insulin Aspart FlexPen and needles out of the reach of children. \u0394 Use Insulin Aspart FlexPen as directed to treat your diabetes. \u0394 Do not share your Insulin Aspart FlexPen or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection. \u0394 Novo Nordisk is not responsible for harm due to using this insulin pen with products not recommended by Novo Nordisk. \u0394 As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your Insulin Aspart FlexPen is lost or damaged. \u0394 Remember to keep the disposable Insulin Aspart FlexPen with you. Do not leave it in a car or other location where it can get too hot or too cold. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See Full Prescribing Information for important preparation, administration, and dosage instructions ( 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 ). \u2022 Subcutaneous injection ( 2.2 ): o Inject subcutaneously within 5-10 minutes before a meal into the abdominal area, thigh, buttocks or upper arm. o Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. o Should generally be used in regimens with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin. \u2022 Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump) ( 2.2 ): o Refer to the insulin infusion pump user manual to see if NovoLog (insulin aspart) can be used. Use in accordance with the insulin pump instructions for use. o Administer by continuous subcutaneous infusion using an insulin pump in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. o Rotate the injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. o Do not mix with other insulins or diluents in the pump. \u2022 Intravenous Administration ( 2.2 ) : o Dilute Insulin Aspart to concentrations from 0.05 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. o Insulin Aspart is stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. \u2022 Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Aspart based on route of administration, the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal ( 2.4 ). \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.4 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions \u2022 Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is NovoLog (insulin aspart) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . \u2022 Inspect Insulin Aspart visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if particulate matter or coloration is seen. \u2022 In patients with visual impairment, use: o Insulin Aspart FlexPen with caution in those who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. o PenFill cartridges with caution. \u2022 Do not mix Insulin Aspart with other insulins when administering using a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump. 2.2 Preparation and Administration Instructions for the Approved Routes of Administration Subcutaneous Injection \u2022 Inject Insulin Aspart subcutaneously within 5-10 minutes before a meal into the abdominal area, thigh, buttocks or upper arm. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. \u2022 Dial the Insulin Aspart FlexPen dials in 1-unit increments. \u2022 Generally use Insulin Aspart (administered by subcutaneous injection) in regimens with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin. \u2022 May dilute this Insulin Aspart product with Insulin Diluting Medium for NovoLog for subcutaneous injection. Diluting one part Insulin Aspart to: o Nine parts diluent will yield a concentration one-tenth that of Insulin Aspart (equivalent to U-10). o One part diluent will yield a concentration one-half that of Insulin Aspart (equivalent to U-50). Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump) \u2022 Can use this Insulin Aspart product with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart). Refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Use Insulin Aspart in accordance with the insulin pump system\u2019s instructions for use. \u2022 Train patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. \u2022 Administer Insulin Aspart by continuous subcutaneous infusion in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. Rotate infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]. \u2022 Instruct patients to follow healthcare provider recommendations when setting basal and meal time infusion rate. \u2022 Change the Insulin Aspart in the reservoir at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter. Follow the NovoLog-specific information for in-use time because NovoLog-specific information may differ from general pump manual instructions. \u2022 Change the infusion set and the infusion set insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. \u2022 Do not dilute or mix Insulin Aspart when administering by continuous subcutaneous infusion. \u2022 Do not expose Insulin Aspart in the pump reservoir to temperatures greater than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). Intravenous Administration \u2022 Administer Insulin Aspart intravenously only under medical supervision with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)]. \u2022 Dilute Insulin Aspart to concentrations from 0.05 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. Insulin Aspart is stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations \u2022 Individualize the dosage of Insulin Aspart based on the route of administration, the patient\u2019s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . \u2022 When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Dosage modification may be needed when Insulin Aspart is used concomitantly with certain drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 2.5 Instructions for Mixing Insulin Aspart with Other Insulins The table below includes instructions regarding mixing Insulin Aspart with other insulins. Subcutaneous injection route \u2022 Insulin Aspart may only be mixed with NPH insulin preparations. \u2022 If Insulin Aspart is mixed with NPH insulin, withdraw Insulin Aspart into the syringe first and inject immediately after mixing. Continuous subcutaneous infusion route (Insulin Pump) Do not mix Insulin Aspart with any other insulin."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge device between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness ( 5. 3). \u2022 Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection ( 5. 4). \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart, treat, and monitor, if indicated ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated ( 5. 6). \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer Insulin Aspart by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Never Share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered. 5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Insulin Aspart may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with Insulin Aspart include: hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of Insulin Aspart was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 39 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 7.9%. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 57 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 8.1%. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Table 1: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 596) Regular Human Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 286) Headache 12 10 Injury accidental 11 10 Nausea 7 5 Diarrhea 5 3 Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 91) Human Regular Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 91) Hyporeflexia 11 7 Onychomycosis 10 5 Sensory disturbance 9 7 Urinary tract infection 8 7 Chest pain 5 3 Headache 5 3 Skin disorder 5 2 Abdominal pain 5 1 Sinusitis 5 1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart . The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in: \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . \u2022 Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 10% at 24 weeks. \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who received Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin, including Insulin Aspart have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, subcutaneously and via subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including Insulin Aspart and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 6-month study with a 6-month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline. In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric: Has not been studied in children with type 2 diabetes. Has not been studied in children with type 1 diabetes <2 years of age (8.4). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a periconceptional HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a periconceptional HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart to improve glycemic control have been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Use of Insulin Aspart for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 283 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 6 to 18 years and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients (n=1,375) treated with Insulin Aspart in 3 controlled clinical studies, 2.6% (n=36) were 65 years of age or over. One-half of these patients had type 1 diabetes (18/1285) and the other half had type 2 diabetes (18/90). The HbA 1c response to Insulin Aspart, as compared to regular human insulin, did not differ by age. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting human insulin analog homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 0 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart. Insulin Aspart injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution for subcutaneous or intravenous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerin (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), sodium chloride (0.58 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart has a pH of 7.2-7.6. Hydrochloric acid 10% and/or sodium hydroxide 10% may be added to adjust pH. Molecular Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Subcutaneous Administration The pharmacodynamic profile of Insulin Aspart given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of Insulin Aspart occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for Insulin Aspart is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as Insulin Aspart may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of Insulin Aspart activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. Insulin Aspart or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mean blood glucose profiles following intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart (hatched curve) and regular human insulin (solid curve) in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. R represents the time of autonomic reaction. Figure 1 Figure 3 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of Insulin Aspart in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either Insulin Aspart or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the Insulin Aspart group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), Insulin Aspart was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of Insulin Aspart were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of Insulin Aspart was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of Insulin Aspart. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any Insulin Aspart pharmacokinetic parameter. Figure 4"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous Insulin Aspart were compared to regular human insulin in 596 type 1 diabetes adult, 187 pediatric type 1 diabetes, and 91 adult type 2 diabetes patients using NPH as basal insulin (see Tables 3, 4, 5). The reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) was similar to regular human insulin. The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by external pump were compared to buffered regular human insulin (administered by CSII), to lispro (administered by CSII) and compared to Insulin Aspart injections and NPH injection. Overall, the reduction in HbA 1c was similar to the comparator. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes with Subcutaneous Injections Type 1 Diabetes \u2013 Adults (see Table 3) Two 24-week, open\u2011label, active-controlled studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart to regular human insulin injection in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Because the two study designs and results were similar, data are shown for only one study (see Table 3). The mean age of the trial population was 39 years and mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years. Fifty-one percent were male. Ninety-four percent were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . Insulin Aspart was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and regular human insulin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes before meals. NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin in either single or divided daily doses. Changes in HbA 1c were comparable for the two treatment regimens in this study (Table 3). Table 3.

This 24-week, parallel-group study of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=283), aged 6 to 18 years, compared two subcutaneous multiple-dose treatment regimens: Insulin Aspart (n=187) or regular human insulin (n=96). NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin. Similar effects on HbA 1c were observed in both treatment groups (Table 4). Subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin have also been compared in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=26) aged 2 to 6 years with similar effects on HbA 1c .

The mean age of the trial population was 56.6 years and mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years. Sixty-three percent were male. Seventy-six percent were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 29.7 kg/m 2 . Insulin Aspart was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and regular human insulin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes before meals. NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin in either single or divided daily doses. Changes in HbA 1c were comparable for the two treatment regimens. Table 5.

This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it is thick, cloudy, or is colored. \u2022 Do not use Insulin Aspart past the expiration date printed on the label. Step 1: Pull off the tamper resistant cap (See Figure A). Step 2: Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure B). Step 3: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (See Figure C). Step 4: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure D). Step 5: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure E). Step 6: Turn the Insulin Aspart vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (See Figure F). \u2022 If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (See Figure G). Step 7: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Insulin Aspart dose (See Figure H). Step 8: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Insulin Aspart. Step 9: Pull the syringe out of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper (See Figure I). Giving your Injection: \u2022 Inject your Insulin Aspart exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. \u2022 Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms, infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump), or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider. \u2022 If you inject Insulin Aspart, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. \u2022 If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, you should change your infusion set and insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. This Insulin Aspart product can be used with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart) - refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Insulin Aspart should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites. Do not insert into the exact same spot for each insertion. Do not insert where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not insert where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. The insulin in the reservoir should be changed at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter, even if you have not used all of the insulin. \u2022 If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, see your insulin pump manual for instructions or talk to your healthcare provider. \u2022 NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with Insulin Aspart. Do not mix Insulin Aspart with any other type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart should only be mixed with NPH insulin if it is going to be injected right away under your skin (subcutaneously). \u2022 Insulin Aspart should be drawn up into the syringe before you draw up your NPH insulin. \u2022 Talk to your healthcare provider if you are not sure about the right way to mix Insulin Aspart and NPH insulin. Step 10: Choose your injection site (stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms) and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose (See Figure J). (Figure J) Step 11: Insert the needle into your skin. Push down on the plunger to inject your dose (See Figure K). The needle should remain in the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the insulin. Step 12: Pull the needle out of your skin. After that, you may see a drop of Insulin Aspart at the needle tip. This is normal and does not affect the dose you just received (See Figure L). \u2022 If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After your injection: \u2022 Do not recap the needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. \u2022 Put the empty insulin vials, used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes and needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. How should I store Insulin Aspart? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart away from heat or light. \u2022 All unopened vials: o Store unopened Insulin Aspart vials in the refrigerator at 36 \u00b0 F to 46 \u00b0 F (2 \u00b0 C to 8 \u00b0 C). o Unopened vials may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if they have been stored in the refrigerator. o Unopened vials should be thrown away after 28 days, if they are stored at room temperature. \u2022 After vials have been opened: o Opened Insulin Aspart vials can be stored in the refrigerator at 36 \u00b0 F to 46 \u00b0 F (2 \u00b0 C to 8 \u00b0 C) or at room temperature below 86 \u00b0 F (30 \u00b0 C). o Throw away all opened Insulin Aspart vials after 28 days, even if they still have insulin left in them. o If using Insulin Aspart in a pump, throw away all opened Insulin Aspart vials after 19 days. General information about the safe and effective use of Insulin Aspart \u2022 Always use a new syringe and needle for each injection. \u2022 Do not share syringes or needles. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart vials, syringes, and needles out of the reach of children.

Introduction Please read the following instructions carefully before using your Insulin Aspart FlexPen. Do not share your Insulin Aspart FlexPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Insulin Aspart FlexPen is a disposable, single-patient-use, dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulin Aspart FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needles. \u0394 People who are blind or have vision problems should not use this Pen without help from a person trained to use the Pen. Getting ready Make sure you have the following items: \u2022 Insulin Aspart FlexPen \u2022 New NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needle \u2022 Alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart FlexPen Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use your Insulin Aspart FlexPen if the liquid contains particles or is colored. A . Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A). Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. B. Attaching the needle Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle. Screw the needle tightly onto your FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram B). Never place a disposable needle on your Insulin Aspart FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection. C. Pull off the big outer needle cap (see diagram C). D. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram D). \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u0394 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \u0394 To reduce the risk of unexpected needle sticks, never put the inner needle cap back on the needle. Giving the airshot before each injection Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to ensure proper dosing: E. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram E). F. Hold your Insulin Aspart FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram F). G. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram G). The dose selector returns to 0. A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times. If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500. A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Selecting your dose Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0. H. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose. The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram H). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out. You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. I. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram I). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. J. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram J). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. If you do not have a sharps container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap. Safely remove the needle and throw it away as soon as you can. \u2022 The used Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. \u2022 Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. \u2022 When there is not enough medicine left in your Insulin Aspart FlexPen for your prescribed dose, the Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. The Insulin Aspart FlexPen prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied. It is designed to deliver 300 units. K . Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram K). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen. How should I store Insulin Aspart FlexPen? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart away from heat or light. \u2022 Store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached. \u2022 Until first use: o Store unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). o Unused FlexPen may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if kept in the refrigerator. o Unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen stored at room temperature should be thrown away after 28 days. \u2022 In-use: o Store the FlexPen you are currently using out of the refrigerator at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. o The Insulin Aspart FlexPen you are using should be thrown away after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Maintenance For the safe and proper use of your FlexPen be sure to handle it with care. Avoid dropping your FlexPen as it may damage it. If you are concerned that your FlexPen is damaged, use a new one. You can clean the outside of your FlexPen by wiping it with a damp cloth. Do not soak or wash your FlexPen as it may damage it. Do not refill your FlexPen. \u0394 Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection. This helps to ensure sterility, prevent leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin for future injections. \u0394 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle sticks and transfer of infectious diseases. \u0394 Keep your Insulin Aspart FlexPen and needles out of the reach of children. \u0394 Use Insulin Aspart FlexPen as directed to treat your diabetes. \u0394 Do not share your Insulin Aspart FlexPen or needles with other people.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge device between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness ( 5. 3). \u2022 Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection ( 5. 4). \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart, treat, and monitor, if indicated ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated ( 5. 6). \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer Insulin Aspart by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Never Share a Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered. 5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Insulin Aspart may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with Insulin Aspart include: hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of Insulin Aspart was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 39 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 7.9%. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to Insulin Aspart of 24 weeks. The mean age was 57 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA 1c at baseline was 8.1%. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Table 1: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 596) Regular Human Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 286) Headache 12 10 Injury accidental 11 10 Nausea 7 5 Diarrhea 5 3 Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator Insulin Aspart + NPH (%) (n= 91) Human Regular Insulin + NPH (%) (n= 91) Hyporeflexia 11 7 Onychomycosis 10 5 Sensory disturbance 9 7 Urinary tract infection 8 7 Chest pain 5 3 Headache 5 3 Skin disorder 5 2 Abdominal pain 5 1 Sinusitis 5 1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart . The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in: \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . \u2022 Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received subcutaneous Insulin Aspart was 10% at 24 weeks. \u2022 Adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who received Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Insulin Aspart via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin, including Insulin Aspart have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, subcutaneously and via subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including Insulin Aspart and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 6-month study with a 6-month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline. In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric: Has not been studied in children with type 2 diabetes. Has not been studied in children with type 1 diabetes <2 years of age (8.4). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a periconceptional HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a periconceptional HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart to improve glycemic control have been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Use of Insulin Aspart for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 283 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 6 to 18 years and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients (n=1,375) treated with Insulin Aspart in 3 controlled clinical studies, 2.6% (n=36) were 65 years of age or over. One-half of these patients had type 1 diabetes (18/1285) and the other half had type 2 diabetes (18/90). The HbA 1c response to Insulin Aspart, as compared to regular human insulin, did not differ by age. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting human insulin analog homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 0 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart. Insulin Aspart injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution for subcutaneous or intravenous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerin (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), sodium chloride (0.58 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart has a pH of 7.2-7.6. Hydrochloric acid 10% and/or sodium hydroxide 10% may be added to adjust pH. Molecular Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Subcutaneous Administration The pharmacodynamic profile of Insulin Aspart given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of Insulin Aspart occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for Insulin Aspart is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as Insulin Aspart may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of Insulin Aspart activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. Insulin Aspart or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mean blood glucose profiles following intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart (hatched curve) and regular human insulin (solid curve) in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. R represents the time of autonomic reaction. Figure 1 Figure 3 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of Insulin Aspart in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either Insulin Aspart or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the Insulin Aspart group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), Insulin Aspart was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of Insulin Aspart were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of Insulin Aspart was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of Insulin Aspart. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any Insulin Aspart pharmacokinetic parameter. Figure 4"

The parameters of Insulin Aspart activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of Insulin Aspart After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Insulin Aspart resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. Insulin Aspart or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3).

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of Insulin Aspart in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of Insulin Aspart (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either Insulin Aspart or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the Insulin Aspart group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), Insulin Aspart was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of Insulin Aspart were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of Insulin Aspart was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of Insulin Aspart. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg Insulin Aspart was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any Insulin Aspart pharmacokinetic parameter. Figure 4"

In 52-week studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with Insulin Aspart at 10, 50, and 200 units/kg/day (approximately 2, 8, and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 units/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively). At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, Insulin Aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Insulin Aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, and in ex vivo UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes. In fertility studies in male and female rats, at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area), no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or general reproductive performance of animals was observed. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in mice and rabbits, one unit of Insulin Aspart has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous Insulin Aspart were compared to regular human insulin in 596 type 1 diabetes adult, 187 pediatric type 1 diabetes, and 91 adult type 2 diabetes patients using NPH as basal insulin (see Tables 3, 4, 5). The reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) was similar to regular human insulin. The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by external pump were compared to buffered regular human insulin (administered by CSII), to lispro (administered by CSII) and compared to Insulin Aspart injections and NPH injection. Overall, the reduction in HbA 1c was similar to the comparator. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes with Subcutaneous Injections Type 1 Diabetes \u2013 Adults (see Table 3) Two 24-week, open\u2011label, active-controlled studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart to regular human insulin injection in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Because the two study designs and results were similar, data are shown for only one study (see Table 3). The mean age of the trial population was 39 years and mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years. Fifty-one percent were male. Ninety-four percent were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . Insulin Aspart was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and regular human insulin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes before meals. NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin in either single or divided daily doses. Changes in HbA 1c were comparable for the two treatment regimens in this study (Table 3). Table 3.

This 24-week, parallel-group study of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=283), aged 6 to 18 years, compared two subcutaneous multiple-dose treatment regimens: Insulin Aspart (n=187) or regular human insulin (n=96). NPH insulin was administered as the basal insulin. Similar effects on HbA 1c were observed in both treatment groups (Table 4). Subcutaneous administration of Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin have also been compared in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (n=26) aged 2 to 6 years with similar effects on HbA 1c .

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Never Share an Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill Cartridge or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients Advise patients that they must never share Insulin Aspart FlexPen, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge devices with another person even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Advise patients using Insulin Aspart vials not to share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Instruct patients on self-management procedures including glucose monitoring, proper injection technique, and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, especially at initiation of Insulin Aspart therapy. Instruct patients on handling of special situations such as intercurrent conditions (illness, stress, or emotional disturbances), an inadequate or skipped insulin dose, inadvertent administration of an increased insulin dose, inadequate food intake, and skipped meals.

Supplies you will need to give your Insulin Aspart injection: \u2022 10 mL Insulin Aspart vial \u2022 insulin syringe and needle \u2022 alcohol swabs Preparing your Insulin Aspart dose: \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Before you start to prepare your injection, check the Insulin Aspart label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. \u2022 Insulin Aspart should look clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it is thick, cloudy, or is colored. \u2022 Do not use Insulin Aspart past the expiration date printed on the label. Step 1: Pull off the tamper resistant cap (See Figure A). Step 2: Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure B). Step 3: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (See Figure C). Step 4: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure D). Step 5: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Insulin Aspart vial (See Figure E). Step 6: Turn the Insulin Aspart vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (See Figure F). \u2022 If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (See Figure G). Step 7: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Insulin Aspart dose (See Figure H). Step 8: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Insulin Aspart. Step 9: Pull the syringe out of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper (See Figure I). Giving your Injection: \u2022 Inject your Insulin Aspart exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. \u2022 Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms, infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump), or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider. \u2022 If you inject Insulin Aspart, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. \u2022 If you use Insulin Aspart in an insulin pump, you should change your infusion set and insertion site according to the manufacturer\u2019s user manual. This Insulin Aspart product can be used with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with NovoLog (insulin aspart) - refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if NovoLog can be used. Insulin Aspart should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites. Do not insert into the exact same spot for each insertion. Do not insert where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not insert where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin.

You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Insulin Aspart can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. I. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram I). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. J. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram J). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. If you do not have a sharps container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap. Safely remove the needle and throw it away as soon as you can. \u2022 The used Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. \u2022 Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. \u2022 When there is not enough medicine left in your Insulin Aspart FlexPen for your prescribed dose, the Insulin Aspart FlexPen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. The Insulin Aspart FlexPen prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied. It is designed to deliver 300 units. K . Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram K). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen. How should I store Insulin Aspart FlexPen? \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Aspart. Do not use Insulin Aspart if it has been frozen. \u2022 Keep Insulin Aspart away from heat or light. \u2022 Store the Insulin Aspart FlexPen without the needle attached. \u2022 Until first use: o Store unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). o Unused FlexPen may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if kept in the refrigerator. o Unused Insulin Aspart FlexPen stored at room temperature should be thrown away after 28 days. \u2022 In-use: o Store the FlexPen you are currently using out of the refrigerator at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. o The Insulin Aspart FlexPen you are using should be thrown away after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Maintenance For the safe and proper use of your FlexPen be sure to handle it with care. Avoid dropping your FlexPen as it may damage it. If you are concerned that your FlexPen is damaged, use a new one. You can clean the outside of your FlexPen by wiping it with a damp cloth. Do not soak or wash your FlexPen as it may damage it. Do not refill your FlexPen. \u0394 Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart FlexPen after each injection. This helps to ensure sterility, prevent leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin for future injections. \u0394 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle sticks and transfer of infectious diseases. \u0394 Keep your Insulin Aspart FlexPen and needles out of the reach of children. \u0394 Use Insulin Aspart FlexPen as directed to treat your diabetes. \u0394 Do not share your Insulin Aspart FlexPen or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection. \u0394 Novo Nordisk is not responsible for harm due to using this insulin pen with products not recommended by Novo Nordisk. \u0394 As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your Insulin Aspart FlexPen is lost or damaged. \u0394 Remember to keep the disposable Insulin Aspart FlexPen with you. Do not leave it in a car or other location where it can get too hot or too cold. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Inspect visually before use. Appearance should be uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm (2.1). \u2022 Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (2.1) . \u2022 Do not administer intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack) (2.2) . \u2022 Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, glycemic control goal ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.2 ). \u2022 When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 may be needed ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions \u2022 Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . \u2022 Inspect Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) visually before use. It should appear uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. \u2022 When using the: o Vial, roll the vial gently in hands in a horizontal position 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. o Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen, roll Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen gently between hands in a horizontal position 10 times. Then, turn Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other 10 times until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately. \u2022 The Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen dials in 1-unit increments. \u2022 Use Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart FlexPen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. \u2022 Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. \u2022 Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . \u2022 Do not administer Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps. \u2022 Do not mix Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with any other insulins. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack). \u2022 Individualize the dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. \u2022 When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Dosage modification may be needed when Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is used concomitantly with certain drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share a Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) . \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2) . \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3) . \u2022 Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection (5.4) . \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, treat, and monitor, if indicated (5.5) . \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6) . \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) . 5.1 Never Share Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) FlexPen should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in: \u2022 Table 1 reflects the exposure of 55 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 43 years old. Sixty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. \u2022 Table 2 reflects the exposure of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 63 years old. Fifty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse reactions that occurred for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart-treated patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=55) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 38 69 Headache 19 35 Influenza-like symptoms 7 13 Dyspepsia 5 9 Back pain 4 7 Diarrhea 4 7 Pharyngitis 4 7 Rhinitis 3 5 Skeletal pain 3 5 Upper respiratory tract infection 3 5 Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=85) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 40 47 Upper respiratory tract infection 10 12 Headache 8 9 Diarrhea 7 8 Neuropathy 7 8 Pharyngitis 5 6 Abdominal pain 4 5 Rhinitis 4 5 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was 16% and 4% for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients respectively at 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Allergic Reactions Patients have experienced reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, have required discontinuation of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 3-month study with an extension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, 100% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study including 91.4% that were positive at baseline. A total of 91.4% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study, including 62.1% that were positive at baseline. In a type 2 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin followed by a decrease approaching to baseline values was observed in Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart and Novolin 70/30 treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have been reported. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [see Data] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from 5 randomized controlled trials of 441 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin aspart during the late 2 nd trimester of pregnancy did not identify an association of insulin aspart with major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials. Animal Data Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have not been established in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger adult patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart has not been studied. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart is a human insulin analog containing 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals and 30% soluble insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C 256 H 381 N 65 O 79 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da. Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is a uniform, white and cloudy, sterile injectable suspension for subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerol (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), protamine sulfate (0.32 mg), sodium chloride (0.877 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 has a pH of 7.20 - 7.44. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Molecular chain of insulin aspart."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A euglycemic clamp study described below assessed glucose utilization after subcutaneous dosing of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects (n = 24). Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes and the mean \u00b1 SD time to peak activity is 2.7 hr \u00b1 0.9 hr. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart reduces the molecule\u2019s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of insulin aspart are maintained by Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart compared to insulin aspart indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C max ) of 61.3 \u00b1 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (see Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profile). Figure 3. Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Distribution and Elimination Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin.

Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart compared to insulin aspart indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C max ) of 61.3 \u00b1 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (see Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profile). Figure 3. Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Distribution and Elimination Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Standard 2-year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30. In 52-week studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with insulin aspart, the rapid-acting component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, at 10, 50, and 200 units/kg/day (approximately 2, 8, and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively). At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, insulin aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known. Insulin aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, and in ex viv o UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes. In fertility studies in male and female rats, insulin aspart at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area) had no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or on general reproductive performance of animals."

Patients had received insulin for at least 24 months before the study. Oral hypoglycemic agents were not allowed within 1 month prior to the study or during the study. The small changes in HbA 1c were comparable across the treatment groups (see Table 4). For patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the mean age was 43 years old, 64% were male, 100% were White, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 , and mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 15 years. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the mean age was 63 years old, 54% were male, 100% were White, the BMI 28.1 kg/m 2 , and the mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 15 years.

The mean age of the trial population was 53 years old and mean duration of diabetes was 9.2 years. Forty-six percent were male. Eighty-five percent were White, 12% were Black and 3% were Asian. The mean BMI was approximately 32.4 kg/m 2 . During an 8-week optimization period metformin and pioglitazone were increased to 2500 mg per day and 30 or 45 mg per day, respectively. After the optimization period, patients were randomized to receive either Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart twice daily added on to the metformin and pioglitazone regimen or continue the current optimized metformin and pioglitazone therapy. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was started at a dose of 6 international units twice daily (before breakfast and before supper). Insulin doses were titrated to a pre-meal glucose goal of 80-110 mg/dL. The total daily insulin dose at the end of the study was 56.9 \u00b1 30.5 international units.

Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was started at an average dose of 5-6 international units (0.07 \u00b1 0.03 international units/kg) twice daily (before breakfast and before supper), and bedtime insulin glargine was started at 10-12 international units (0.13 \u00b1 0.03 international units/kg). Insulin doses were titrated weekly by decrements or increments of -2 to +6 units per injection to a pre-meal glucose goal of 80-110 mg/dL. The metformin dose was adjusted to 2,550 mg/day. Approximately one-third of the patients in each group were also treated with pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Insulin secretagogues were discontinued in order to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Most patients were White (53%), and the mean initial weight was 90 kg. The mean age of the trial population was 53 years old and mean duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Fifty three percent were male. Fifty-five percent were White, 15% Black, 27% were Hispanic, 2% were Asian and 2% were Other. The mean BMI was approximately 31.5 kg/m 2 .

This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should look cloudy after mixing. Before your first injection with a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen you must mix the insulin: A. Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix. Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A). B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (see diagram B). C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position 1 and 2 as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other (see diagram C). Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles. For every following injection move the pen up and down between positions 1 and 2 at least ten times until the liquid appears white and cloudy. After mixing, complete all the following steps of the injection right away. If there is a delay, the insulin will need to be mixed again. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Before you inject, there must be at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to make sure the remaining insulin is evenly mixed. If there are less than 12 units left, use a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen. Attaching the needle D. Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle.

F. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram F). \u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection to make sure the needle is free of germs (sterile) and to prevent blocked needles. Do not reuse or share your needles or syringes with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. \u2022 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \u2022 To reduce the risk of a needle stick, never put the inner needle cap back on the needle. Giving the airshot before each injection Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to make sure you take the right dose of insulin : G. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram G). H. Hold your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram H). I. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram I). The dose selector returns to 0. A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times. If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500. A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Selecting your dose Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0. J. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose. The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram J). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out. You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose. \u2022 Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin. Giving the injection \u2022 Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. \u2022 Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms. \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. K. Insert the needle into your skin. Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram K). Be careful only to push the button when injecting. Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. L. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram L). This will make sure that the full dose has been given. You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. Do not rub the area. After the injection Do not recap the needle. Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin. \u2022 Put your used needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap and throw it away in a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal .
