      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In cell cultures the inhibitory activity of ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is selective. The mechanism of action is unknown. Reversal of the in vitro antiviral activity by guanosine or xanthosine suggests ribavirin may act as an analogue of these cellular metabolites. Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 \u03bcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown. Immunologic Effects Neutralizing antibody responses to RSV were decreased in aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treated infants compared to placebo treated infants. 3 One study also showed that RSV-specific IgE antibody in bronchial secretions was decreased in patients treated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. In rats, ribavirin administration resulted in lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Humoral immunity was reduced in guinea pigs and ferrets. Cellular immunity was also mildly depressed in animal studies. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Assay for ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u00b5M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u00b5M. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u00b5M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u00b5M. The bioavailability of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations many fold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined. Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen in the lungs following exposure at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus. Treatment early in the course of severe lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection should be treated with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. The vast majority of infants and children with RSV infection have disease that is mild, self-limited, and does not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. Many children with mild lower respiratory tract involvement will require shorter hospitalization than would be required for a full course of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP aerosol (3 to 7 days) and should not be treated with the drug. Thus the decision to treat with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be based on the severity of the RSV infection. The presence of an underlying condition such as prematurity, immunosuppression or cardiopulmonary disease may increase the severity of clinical manifestations and complications of RSV infection. Use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in patients requiring mechanical ventilator assistance should be undertaken only by physicians and support staff familiar with this mode of administration and the specific ventilator being used (see WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Diagnosis RSV infection should be documented by a rapid diagnostic method such as demonstration of viral antigen in respiratory tract secretions by immunofluorescence 3,4 or ELISA 5 before or during the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection. Non-culture antigen detection techniques may have false positive or false negative results. Assessment of the clinical situation, the time of year and other parameters may warrant reevaluation of the laboratory diagnosis. Description of Studies Non-Mechanically-Ventilated Infants: In two placebo controlled trials in infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment had a therapeutic effect, as judged by the reduction in severity of clinical manifestations of disease by treatment day 3. 3,4 Treatment was most effective when instituted within the first 3 days of clinical illness. Virus titers in respiratory secretions were also significantly reduced with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in one of these original studies. 4 Additional controlled studies conducted since these initial trials of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in the treatment of RSV infection have supported these data. Mechanically-Ventilated Infants : A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP at the recommended dose was conducted in 28 infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by documented RSV infection. 6 Mean age was 1.4 months (SD, 1.7 months). Seven patients had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection and 21 were previously normal. Aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment significantly decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation required (4.9 vs. 9.9 days, p=0.01) and duration of required supplemental oxygen (8.7 vs. 13.5 days, p=0.01). Intensive patient management and monitoring techniques were employed in this study. These included endotracheal tube suctioning every 1 to 2 hours; recording of proximal airway pressure, ventilatory rate, and F l O 2 every hour; and arterial blood gas monitoring every 2 to 6 hours. To reduce the risk of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation and ventilator malfunction, heated wire tubing, two bacterial filters connected in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator (with filter changes every 4 hours), and water column pressure release valves to monitor internal ventilator pressures were used in connecting ventilator circuits to the SPAG-2. Employing these techniques, no technical difficulties with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administration were encountered during the study. Adverse events consisted of bacterial pneumonia in one case, staphyloccus bacteremia in one case and two cases of post-extubation stridor. None were felt to be related to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administration."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Therefore, although clinical studies have not been performed, it should be assumed that ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. Studies in which the drug has been administered systemically demonstrate that ribavirin is concentrated in the red blood cells and persists for the life of the erythrocyte."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS SUDDEN DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATION OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP USE IN INFANTS. Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and reinstituted only with extreme caution, continuous monitoring, and consideration of concomitant administration of bronchodilators. Use with Mechanical Ventilators USE OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP IN PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY BY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH THIS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE SPECIFIC VENTILATOR BEING USED. Strict attention must be paid to procedures that have been shown to minimize the accumulation of drug precipitate, which can result in mechanical ventilator dysfunction and associated increased pulmonary pressures. These procedures include the use of bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit with frequent changes (every 4 hours), water column pressure release valves to indicate elevated ventilator pressures, frequent monitoring of these devices and verification that ribavirin crystals have not accumulated within the ventilator circuitry, and frequent suctioning and monitoring of the patient (see Clinical Studies). Those administering aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in conjunction with mechanical ventilator use should be thoroughly familiar with detailed descriptions of these procedures as outlined in the SPAG-2 manual."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory syncytial virus require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status (see SPAG-2 manual). Drug Interactions Clinical studies of interactions of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with other drugs commonly used to treat infants with RSV infections, such as digoxin, bronchodilators, other antiviral agents, antibiotics or anti-metabolites, have not been conducted. Interference by ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with laboratory tests has not been evaluated. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin increased the incidence of cell transformations and mutations in mouse Balb/c 3T3 (fibroblasts) and L5178Y (lymphoma) cells at concentrations of 0.015 and 0.03-5.0 mg/mL, respectively (without metabolic activation). Modest increases in mutation rates (3-4x) were observed at concentrations between 3.75-10.0 mg/mL in L5178Y cells in vitro with the addition of a metabolic activation fraction. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ribavirin was clastogenic at intravenous doses of 20-200 mg/kg, (estimated human equivalent of 1.67-16.7 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult). Ribavirin was not mutagenic in a dominant lethal assay in rats at intraperitoneal doses between 50-200 mg/kg when administered for 5 days (estimated human equivalent of 7.14-28.6 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). In vivo carcinogenicity studies with ribavirin are incomplete. However, results of a chronic feeding study with ribavirin in rats, at doses of 16-100 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.3-14.3 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult), suggest that ribavirin may induce benign mammary, pancreatic, pituitary and adrenal tumors. Preliminary results of 2 oral gavage oncogenicity studies in the mouse and rat (18-24 months; doses of 20-75 and 10-40 mg/kg/day, respectively [estimated human equivalent of 1.67-6.25 and 1.43-5.71 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult]) are inconclusive as to the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin (see Pharmacokinetics ). However, these studies have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages in mice) and retinal degeneration (in rats). Impairment of Fertility The fertility of ribavirin-treated animals (male or female) has not been fully investigated. However, in the mouse, administration of ribavirin at doses between 35-150 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.92-12.5 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult) resulted in significant seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm concentrations, and increased numbers of sperm with abnormal morphology. Partial recovery of sperm production was apparent 3-6 months following dose cessation. In several additional toxicology studies, ribavirin has been shown to cause testicular lesions (tubular atrophy) in adult rats at oral dose levels as low as 16 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.29 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). Lower doses were not tested. The reproductive capacity of treated male animals has not been studied. Pregnancy: Category X Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Teratogenic effects were evident after single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater in the hamster, and after daily oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the rabbit and rat, respectively (estimated human equivalent doses of 0.12 and 0.14 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult). Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced. Ribavirin caused embryolethality in the rabbit at daily oral dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were evident in the rabbit and rat administered daily oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively with estimated human equivalent doses of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment (see Pharmacokinetics ). These doses are considered to define the \"No Observable Teratogenic Effects Level\" (NOTEL) for ribavirin in the rabbit and rat. Following oral administration of ribavirin in the pregnant rat (1.0 mg/kg) and rabbit (0.3 mg/kg), mean plasma levels of drug ranged from 0.10-0.20 \u00b5M[0.024-0.049 \u00b5/mL] at 1 hour after dosing, to undetectable levels at 24 hours. At 1 hour following the administration of 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg in the rat and rabbit (NOTEL), respectively, mean plasma levels of drug in both species were near or below the limit of detection (0.05 \u00b5M; see Pharmacokinetics ). Although clinical studies have not been performed, ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. As noted previously, ribavirin is concentrated in red blood cells and persists for the life of the cell. Thus the terminal half-life for the systemic elimination of ribavirin is essentially that of the half-life of circulating erythrocytes. The minimum interval following exposure to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP before pregnancy may be safely initiated is unknown (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and Information for Health Care Personnel ). Nursing Mothers Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP has been shown to be toxic to lactating animals and their offspring. It is not known if ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is excreted in human milk. Information for Health Care Personnel Health care workers directly providing care to patients receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be aware that ribavirin has been shown to be teratogenic in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Although no reports of teratogenesis in offspring of mothers who were exposed to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP during pregnancy have been confirmed, no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Studies of environmental exposure in treatment settings have shown that the drug can disperse into the immediate bedside area during routine patient care activities with highest ambient levels closest to the patient and extremely low levels outside of the immediate bedside area. Adverse reactions resulting from actual occupational exposure in adults are described below (see Adverse Events in Health Care Workers ). Some studies have documented ambient drug concentrations at the bedside that could potentially lead to systemic exposures above those considered safe for exposure during pregnancy (1/1000 of the NOTEL dose in the most sensitive animal species). 7,8,9 A 1992 study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrated measurable urine levels of ribavirin in health care workers exposed to aerosol in the course of direct patient care. 7 Levels were lowest in workers caring for infants receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with mechanical ventilation and highest in those caring for patients being administered the drug via an oxygen tent or hood. This study employed a more sensitive assay to evaluate ribavirin levels in urine than was available for several previous studies of environmental exposure that failed to detect measurable ribavirin levels in exposed workers. Creatinine adjusted urine levels in the NIOSH study ranged from less than 0.001 to 0.140 \u00b5M of ribavirin per gram of creatinine in exposed workers. However, the relationship between urinary ribavirin levels in exposed workers, plasma levels in animal studies, and the specific risk of teratogenesis in exposed pregnant women is unknown. It is good practice to avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to chemicals wherever possible. Hospitals are encouraged to conduct training programs to minimize potential occupational exposure to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. Health care workers who are pregnant should consider avoiding direct care of patients receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. If close patient contact cannot be avoided, precautions to limit exposure should be taken. These include administration of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in negative pressure rooms; adequate room ventilation (at least six air exchanges per hour); the use of aerosol scavenging devices; turning off the SPAG-2 device for 5 to 10 minutes prior to prolonged patient contact; and wearing appropriately fitted respirator masks. Surgical masks do not provide adequate filtration of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP particles. Further information is available from NIOSH's Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch and additional recommendations have been published in an Aerosol Consensus Statement by the American Respiratory Care Foundation and the American Association for Respiratory Care. 10"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The description of adverse reactions is based on events from clinical studies (approximately 200 patients) conducted prior to 1986, and the controlled trial of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP conducted in 1989-1990. Additional data from spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse events in individual patients have been available since 1986. Deaths Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP (12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections). Several cases have been characterized as \"possibly related\" to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP by the treating physician; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug. Several other cases have been attributed to mechanical ventilator malfunction in which ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation within the ventilator apparatus led to excessively high pulmonary pressures and diminished oxygenation. In these cases the monitoring procedures described in the current package insert were not employed (see Description of Studies , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Pulmonary function significantly deteriorated during aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment in six of six adults with chronic obstructive lung disease and in four of six asthmatic adults. Dyspnea and chest soreness were also reported in the latter group. Minor abnormalities in pulmonary function were also seen in healthy adult volunteers. In the original study population of approximately 200 infants who received aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP, several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with life-threatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. The role of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in these events is indeterminate. Since the drug's approval in 1986, additional reports of similar serious, though non-fatal, events have been filed infrequently. Events associated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP use have included the following: Pulmonary: Worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, hypoventilation, cyanosis, dyspnea, bacterial pneumonia, pneumothorax, apnea, atelectasis and ventilator dependence. Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia and digitalis toxicity. Bigeminy, bradycardia and tachycardia have been described in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation experienced serious difficulties, due to inadequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (\"rain out\") has also been noted. Measures to avoid these complications should be followed carefully (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hematologic Although anemia was not reported with use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in controlled clinical trials, most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 to 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Anemia has been shown to occur frequently with experimental oral and intravenous ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in humans. Also, cases of anemia (type unspecified), reticulocytosis and hemolytic anemia associated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP use have been reported through post-marketing reporting systems. All have been reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Other Rash and conjunctivitis have been associated with the use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. These usually resolve within hours of discontinuing therapy. Seizures and asthenia associated with experimental intravenous ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP therapy have also been reported. Adverse Events in Health Care Workers Studies of environmental exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in health care workers administering care to patients receiving the drug have not detected adverse signs or symptoms related to exposure. However, 152 health care workers have reported experiencing adverse events through post-marketing surveillance. Nearly all were in individuals providing direct care to infants receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. Of 358 events from these 152 individual health care worker reports, the most common signs and symptoms were headache (51% of reports), conjunctivitis (32%), and rhinitis, nausea, rash, dizziness, pharyngitis, or lacrimation (10-20% each). Several cases of bronchospasm and/or chest pain were also reported, usually in individuals with known underlying reactive airway disease. Several case reports of damage to contact lenses after prolonged close exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP have also been reported. Most signs and symptoms reported as having occurred in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of discontinuing close exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP (also see Information for Health Care Personnel ). The symptoms of RSV in adults can include headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat and/or cough, fever, hoarseness, nasal congestion and wheezing, although RSV infections in adults are typically mild and transient. Such infections represent a potential hazard to uninfected hospital patients. It is unknown whether certain symptoms cited in reports from health care workers were due to exposure to the drug or infection with RSV. Hospitals should implement appropriate infection control procedures."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BEFORE USE, READ THOROUGHLY THE VALEANT SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR SPAG-2 OPERATOR'S MANUAL FOR SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS. AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED WITH ANY OTHER AEROSOL GENERATING DEVICE. The recommended treatment regimen is 20 mg/mL ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP as the starting solution in the drug reservoir of the SPAG-2 unit, with continuous aerosol administration for 12-18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days. Using the recommended drug concentration of 20 mg/mL the average aerosol concentration for a 12 hour delivery period would be 190 micrograms/liter of air. Aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should not be administered in a mixture for combined aerosolization or simultaneously with other aerosolized medications. Non-mechanically ventilated infants Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be delivered to an infant oxygen hood from the SPAG-2 aerosol generator. Administration by face mask or oxygen tent may be necessary if a hood cannot be employed (see SPAG-2 manual). However, the volume and condensation area are larger in a tent and this may alter delivery dynamics of the drug. Mechanically Ventilated Infants The recommended dose and administration schedule for infants who require mechanical ventilation is the same as for those who do not. Either a pressure or volume cycle ventilator may be used in conjunction with the SPAG-2. In either case, patients should have their endotracheal tubes suctioned every 1-2 hours, and their pulmonary pressures monitored frequently (every 2-4 hours). For both pressure and volume ventilators, heated wire connective tubing and bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the system (which must be changed frequently, i.e., every 4 hours) must be used to minimize the risk of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation in the system and the subsequent risk of ventilator dysfunction. Water column pressure release valves should be used in the ventilator circuit for pressure cycled ventilators, and may be utilized with volume cycled ventilators (SEE SPAG-2 MANUAL FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS). Method of Preparation Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is supplied as 6 grams of lyophilized powder per 100 mL vial for aerosol administration only. By sterile technique, reconstitute drug with a minimum of 75 mL of sterile water for injection, USP or sterile water for inhalation, USP in the original 100 mL glass vial. Shake well . Transfer to the clean, sterilized 500 mL SPAG-2 reservoir and further dilute to a final volume of 300 mL with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Inhalation.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin capsules are a nucleoside analogue indicated in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated) for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) in patients 3 years of age or older with compensated liver disease. ( 1.1 ) Patients with the following characteristics are less likely to benefit from re-treatment after failing a course of therapy: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection. 1.1 Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) Ribavirin capsules in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated) are indicated for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) in patients 3 years of age and older with compensated liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 , 5.10) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The following points should be considered when initiating ribavirin capsules combination therapy with PegIntron \u00ae or INTRON A \u00ae : Combination therapy with ribavirin capsules/PegIntron is preferred over ribavirin capsules/INTRON A as this combination provides substantially better response rates [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Patients with the following characteristics are less likely to benefit from re-treatment after failing a course of therapy: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No safety and efficacy data are available for treatment duration lasting longer than one year."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ribavirin capsules are administered according to body weight. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) Dose reduction or discontinuation is recommended in patients experiencing certain adverse reactions or renal dysfunction. ( 2.5 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Do not open, crush or break ribavirin capsules. Ribavirin capsules should be taken with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.2 Ribavirin capsules/PegIntron Combination Therapy Adult Patients The recommended dose of ribavirin capsules when used in combination with PegIntron is 800 mg to 1,400 mg based on patient body weight in two divided doses (see Table 1). Refer to PegIntron labeling for PegIntron dosing information. Duration of Treatment \u2013 Interferon Alpha-na\u00efve Patients The treatment duration for patients with genotype 1 is 48 weeks. Discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who do not achieve at least a 2 log 10 drop or loss of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA at 12 weeks, or if HCV-RNA remains detectable after 24 weeks of therapy. Patients with genotype 2 and 3 should be treated for 24 weeks. Duration of Treatment \u2013 Re-treatment with PegIntron/Ribavirin capsules of Prior Treatment Failures The treatment duration for patients who previously failed therapy is 48 weeks, regardless of HCV genotype. Re-treated patients who fail to achieve undetectable HCV-RNA at Week 12 of therapy, or whose HCV-RNA remains detectable after 24 weeks of therapy, are highly unlikely to achieve SVR and discontinuation of therapy should be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].

Refer to Intron A labeling for interferon dosing information. The recommended duration of treatment for patients previously untreated with interferon is 24 to 48 weeks. The duration of treatment should be individualized to the patient depending on baseline disease characteristics, response to therapy, and tolerability of the regimen [see Indications and Usage (1.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Studies (14) ]. After 24 weeks of treatment, virologic response should be assessed. Treatment discontinuation should be considered in any patient who has not achieved an HCV-RNA below the limit of detection of the assay by 24 weeks. There are no safety and efficacy data for treatment duration lasting longer than 48 weeks in the previously untreated patient population. Duration of Treatment \u2013 Re-treatment with INTRON A/Ribavirin capsules in Relapse Patients In patients who relapse following nonpegylated interferon monotherapy, the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

Refer to Intron A labeling for interferon dosing information. The recommended duration of treatment is 48 weeks for pediatric patients with genotype 1. After 24 weeks of treatment, virologic response should be assessed. Treatment discontinuation should be considered in any patient who has not achieved an HCV-RNA below the limit of detection of the assay by this time. The recommended duration of treatment for pediatric patients with genotype 2 and 3 is 24 weeks. 2.4 Testing Prior to Initiation of Ribavirin capsules The following laboratory tests are recommended in all patients treated with ribavirin capsules prior to initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Standard hematologic tests - including hemoglobin (pretreatment, Week 2 and Week 4 of therapy, and as clinically appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ], complete and differential white blood cell counts, and platelet count. Blood chemistries - liver function tests and TSH. Pregnancy - in women of childbearing potential. ECG [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.5 Dose Modifications If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during ribavirin capsules combination therapy, modify or discontinue the dose until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity (see Table 4) [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment, combination therapy should be discontinued. Refer to PegIntron labeling for additional information regarding dose reduction of PegIntron. Dose reduction in pediatric patients is accomplished by modifying the recommended ribavirin capsules dose from the original starting dose of 15 mg/kg daily in a two-step process to 12 mg/kg/day, then to 8 mg/kg/day, if needed (see Table 4). Ribavirin capsules are contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) ] . Patients with impaired renal function and those over the age of 50 should be carefully monitored with respect to development of anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ribavirin capsules should be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Assess cardiovascular status before initiation of treatment and during therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, discontinue combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In patients with a history of stable cardiovascular disease, a permanent dose reduction is required if the hemoglobin decreases by 2 g/dL or more during any 4-week period. If the hemoglobin level remains below 12 g/dL after 4 weeks on a reduced dose, discontinue combination therapy. Modify or discontinue ribavirin capsules dosing in any patient whose hemoglobin level falls below 10 g/dL (see Table 4) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Table 4: Guidelines for Dose Modification and Discontinuation of Ribavirin capsules in combination with PegIntron or INTRON A Based on Laboratory Parameters in Adults and Pediatrics Laboratory Parameters Reduce Ribavirin capsules Daily Dose (see note 1) if: Reduce PegIntron or INTRON A Dose (see note 2) if: Discontinue Therapy if: Note 1: Adult patients: 1 st dose reduction of ribavirin is by 200 mg/day (except in patients receiving the 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2 nd dose reduction of ribavirin is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of ribavirin is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the evening. Pediatric patients: 1 st dose reduction of ribavirin is to 12 mg/kg/day, 2 nd dose reduction of ribavirin is to 8 mg/kg/day. Note 2: Adult patients treated with ribavirin capsules and PegIntron: 1 st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 1 mcg/kg/week. If needed, 2 nd dose reduction of PegIntron is to 0.5 mcg/kg/week. Pediatric patients treated with ribavirin capsules and PegIntron: 1 st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 40 mcg/m 2 /week, 2 nd dose reduction of PegIntron is to 20 mcg/m 2 /week. For patients on ribavirin capsules /INTRON A combination therapy : reduce INTRON A dose by 50%. * Pediatric patients who have pre-existing cardiac conditions and experience a hemoglobin decrease greater than or equal to 2 g/dL during any 4-week period during treatment should have weekly evaluations and hematology testing. \u2020 These guidelines are for patients with stable cardiac disease. Patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not be treated with PegIntron/ribavirin capsules combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .

Regardless of genotype, previously treated patients who have detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12 or 24 are highly unlikely to achieve SVR and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Pediatrics (3 to 17 years of age) In patients receiving PegIntron/ribavirin capsules combination (excluding HCV Genotype 2 and 3), discontinue therapy at 12 weeks if HCV-RNA has dropped less than 2 log 10 compared to pretreatment level, or at 24 weeks if HCV-RNA is still detectable."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin capsules combination therapy is contraindicated in: pregnancy. Ribavirin capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Ribavirin capsules are contraindicated in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking ribavirin capsules, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. men whose female partners are pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] patients with known hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic, epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme to ribavirin or any component of the product patients with autoimmune hepatitis patients with hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle-cell anemia) patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] when coadministered with didanosine because exposure to the active metabolite of didanosine (dideoxyadenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate) is increased. Fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine in combination with ribavirin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ].

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm. Patients should have a negative pregnancy test prior to therapy and use effective contraception and undergo periodic pregnancy tests. ( 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Patients exhibiting the following conditions should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy: Hemolytic anemia may occur with a significant initial drop in hemoglobin. ( 5.2 ) Pancreatitis. ( 5.3 ) Pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment. ( 5.4 ) New or worsening ophthalmologic disorders. ( 5.5 ) Severe decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, and hematologic, endocrine (e.g., TSH), and hepatic abnormalities. ( 5.6 ) Dental/periodontal disorders reported with combination therapy. ( 5.7 ) Concomitant administration of azathioprine. ( 5.8 ) Weight loss and growth inhibition reported during combination therapy in pediatric patients. Long-term growth inhibition (height) reported in some patients. ( 5.9 ) Monotherapy with ribavirin is not permitted. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Ribavirin capsules may cause birth defects, miscarriage or stillbirth. Ribavirin therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of therapy. Female patients should use effective contraception and have periodic monitoring with pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 9-month period after treatment has been stopped. Male patients and their female partners should use effective contraception during treatment and during the 6-month period after treatment has been stopped. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects in all animal species tested. These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin. [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 5.2 Anemia Hemolytic anemia was observed in approximately 10% of ribavirin/INTRON A-treated subjects in clinical trials. The anemia associated with ribavirin occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy. Because the initial drop in hemoglobin may be significant, obtain hemoglobin or hematocrit levels before the start of treatment and at Week 2 and Week 4 of therapy, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Patients should then be followed as clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 , 2.6) ]. Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions have been reported in patients with anemia caused by ribavirin. Patients should be assessed for underlying cardiac disease before initiation of ribavirin therapy. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment and should be appropriately monitored during therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be suspended or discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 , 2.6) ]. Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug-induced anemia, patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use ribavirin. 5.3 Pancreatitis Suspend ribavirin and INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy in patients with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinue in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. 5.4 Pulmonary Disorders Pulmonary symptoms, including dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia, have been reported during ribavirin with alpha interferon combination therapy; occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred. In addition, sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported. If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment, closely monitor the patient, and if appropriate, discontinue combination therapy. 5.5 Ophthalmologic Disorders Ribavirin is used in combination therapy with INTRON A or PegIntron. Refer to labeling for PegIntron for additional information. 5.6 Laboratory Tests PegIntron in combination with ribavirin may cause severe decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, and hematologic, endocrine (e.g., TSH), and hepatic abnormalities. Obtain hematology and blood chemistry testing in patients on PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy before the start of treatment and then periodically thereafter. In the adult clinical trial, complete blood counts (including hemoglobin, neutrophil, and platelet counts) and chemistries (including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and uric acid) were measured during the treatment period at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and then at 6-week intervals, or more frequently if abnormalities developed. In pediatric subjects, the same laboratory parameters were evaluated with additional assessment of hemoglobin at treatment Week 6. TSH levels were measured every 12 weeks during the treatment period. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.7 Dental and Periodontal Disorders Dental and periodontal disorders have been reported in patients receiving ribavirin and interferon or peginterferon combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of ribavirin and pegylated or nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. Advise patients to brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. If vomiting occurs, advise patients to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. 5.8 Concomitant Administration of Azathioprine Pancytopenia (marked decreases in red blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited number of patients (n=8), myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. Discontinue PegIntron, ribavirin, and azathioprine for pancytopenia, and do not reintroduce pegylated interferon/ribavirin with concomitant azathioprine [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.9 Impact on Growth in Pediatric Patients Data on the effects of PegIntron and ribavirin on growth come from an open-label study in subjects 3 through 17 years of age, in which weight and height changes were compared to U.S. normative population data. In general, the weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron and ribavirin lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than 3 rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects while on treatment. Following treatment, rebound growth and weight gain occurred in most subjects. Long-term follow-up data in pediatric subjects, however, indicates that PegIntron in combination therapy with ribavirin may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced adult height in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Similarly, an impact on growth was seen in subjects after treatment with ribavirin and INTRON A combination therapy for one year. In a long-term follow-up trial of a limited number of these subjects, combination therapy resulted in reduced final adult height in some subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.10 Not Recommended for Monotherapy and Risks Associated with Combination Therapy Based on results of clinical trials, ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection; therefore, ribavirin capsules must not be used alone. The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules have only been established when used together with INTRON A or PegIntron (not other interferons) as combination therapy. The safety and efficacy of ribavirin with INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection, adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, or influenza infections have not been established. Ribavirin capsules should not be used for these indications. There are significant adverse reactions caused by ribavirin/INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy, including severe depression and suicidal or homicidal ideation, hemolytic anemia, suppression of bone marrow function, autoimmune and infectious disorders, pulmonary dysfunction, pancreatitis, and diabetes. Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% versus 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up. Labeling for INTRON A and PegIntron should be reviewed in their entirety for additional safety information prior to initiation of combination treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse drug reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Pulmonary Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Ophthalmic Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Dental and Periodontal Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Impact on Growth in Pediatric Patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Hemolytic anemia occurred in more than 10% of adult patients receiving ribavirin/PegIntron or INTRON A combination therapy. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (40% or greater) in adult patients receiving ribavirin/PegIntron or INTRON A combination therapy are injection site reaction, fatigue/asthenia, headache, rigors, fevers, nausea, myalgia and anxiety/emotional lability/irritability. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (greater than 25%) in pediatric patients receiving ribavirin/PegIntron therapy are: pyrexia, headache, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, injection site erythema, and vomiting. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical trials with ribavirin in combination with PegIntron or INTRON A have been conducted in over 7,800 subjects from 3 to 76 years of age. The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia. Reductions in hemoglobin levels occurred within the first 1 to 2 weeks of oral therapy. Cardiac and pulmonary reactions associated with anemia occurred in approximately 10% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Greater than 96% of all subjects in clinical trials experienced one or more adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in adult subjects receiving PegIntron or INTRON A in combination with ribavirin were injection site inflammation/reaction, fatigue/asthenia, headache, rigors, fevers, nausea, myalgia and anxiety/emotional lability/irritability. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric subjects, ages 3 and older, receiving ribavirin in combination with PegIntron or INTRON A were pyrexia, headache, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, injection site erythema, and vomiting. The Adverse Reactions section references the following clinical trials: Ribavirin/PegIntron Combination therapy trials: Clinical Study 1 \u2013 evaluated PegIntron monotherapy (not further described in this label; see labeling for PegIntron for information about this trial). Study 2 \u2013 evaluated ribavirin 800 mg/day flat dose in combination with 1.5 mcg/kg/week PegIntron or with INTRON A. Study 3 \u2013 evaluated PegIntron/weight-based ribavirin in combination with PegIntron/flat dose ribavirin regimen. Study 4 \u2013 compared two PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg/week and 1 mcg/kg/week) doses in combination with ribavirin and a third treatment group receiving Pegasys \u00ae (180 mcg/week)/Copegus \u00ae (1000 to 1200 mg/day). Study 5 \u2013 evaluated PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg/week) in combination with weight-based ribavirin in prior treatment failure subjects. PegIntron/Ribavirin Combination Therapy in Pediatric Patients Ribavirin/INTRON A Combination Therapy trials for adults and pediatrics Serious adverse reactions have occurred in approximately 12% of subjects in clinical trials with PegIntron with or without ribavirin [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The most common serious events occurring in subjects treated with PegIntron and ribavirin were depression and suicidal ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ], each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% versus 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. The most common fatal reaction occurring in subjects treated with PegIntron and ribavirin was cardiac arrest, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] , all occurring in less than 1% of subjects.

In Study 2, the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 17% in the PegIntron/ribavirin groups compared to 14% in the INTRON A/ribavirin group. In Study 3, there was a similar incidence of serious adverse reactions reported for the weight-based ribavirin group (12%) and for the flat-dose ribavirin regimen. In many but not all cases, adverse reactions resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Some subjects experienced ongoing or new serious adverse reactions during the 6-month follow-up period. In Study 2, many subjects continued to experience adverse reactions several months after discontinuation of therapy. By the end of the 6-month follow-up period, the incidence of ongoing adverse reactions by body class in the PegIntron 1.5/ribavirin group was 33% (psychiatric), 20% (musculoskeletal), and 10% (for endocrine and for GI). In approximately 10 to 15% of subjects, weight loss, fatigue, and headache had not resolved. There have been 28 subject deaths that occurred during treatment or follow-up in Studies 2, 3, and 4. In Study 2, there was 1 suicide in a subject receiving PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy; and 1 subject death in the INTRON A/ribavirin group (motor vehicle accident). In Study 3, there were 14 deaths, 2 of which were probable suicides and 1 was an unexplained death in a person with a relevant medical history of depression. In Study 4, there were 12 deaths, 6 of which occurred in subjects who received PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy, 5 in the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm (N=1019) and 1 in the PegIntron 1 mcg/ribavirin arm (N=1016), and 6 of which occurred in subjects receiving Pegasys/Copegus (N=1035); there were 3 suicides that occurred during the off treatment follow-up period in subjects who received PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy. In Studies 1 and 2, 10 to 14% of subjects receiving PegIntron, alone or in combination with ribavirin, discontinued therapy compared with 6% treated with INTRON A alone and 13% treated with INTRON A in combination with ribavirin. In Study 3, 15% of subjects receiving PegIntron in combination with weight-based ribavirin and 14% of subjects receiving PegIntron with flat-dose ribavirin discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction. The most common reasons for discontinuation were related to known interferon effects of psychiatric, systemic (e.g., fatigue, headache), or gastrointestinal adverse reactions. In Study 4, 13% of subjects in the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm, 10% in the PegIntron 1 mcg/ribavirin arm, and 13% in the Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus arm discontinued due to adverse events. In Study 2, dose reductions for ribavirin were similar across all three groups [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 33 to 35%. The most common reasons for dose modifications were neutropenia (18%), or anemia (9%) (see Laboratory Values). Other common reasons included depression, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. In Study 3, dose modifications due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently with weight-based ribavirin dosing compared to flat dosing (29% and 23%, respectively). In Study 4, 16% of subjects had a dose reduction of PegIntron to 1 mcg/kg in combination with ribavirin, with an additional 4% requiring the second dose reduction of PegIntron to 0.5 mcg/kg due to adverse events compared to 15% of subjects in the Pegasys/Copegus arm, who required a dose reduction to 135 mcg/week with Pegasys, with an additional 7% in the Pegasys/Copegus arm requiring a second dose reduction to 90 mcg/week with Pegasys. In the PegIntron/ribavirin combination trials the most common adverse reactions were psychiatric, which occurred among 77% of subjects in Study 2 and 68% to 69% of subjects in Study 3. These psychiatric adverse reactions included most commonly depression, irritability, and insomnia, each reported by approximately 30% to 40% of subjects in all treatment groups. Suicidal behavior (ideation, attempts, and suicides) occurred in 2% of all subjects during treatment or during follow-up after treatment cessation [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . In Study 4, psychiatric adverse reactions occurred in 58% of subjects in the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm, 55% of subjects in the PegIntron 1 mcg/ribavirin arm, and 57% of subjects in the Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus arm. In Study 2, PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy induced fatigue or headache in approximately two-thirds of subjects, with fever or rigors in approximately half of the subjects. The severity of some of these systemic symptoms (e.g., fever and headache) tended to decrease as treatment continued. Subjects receiving ribavirin/PegIntron as re-treatment after failing a previous interferon combination regimen reported adverse reactions similar to those previously associated with this regimen during clinical trials of treatment-na\u00efve subjects. Pediatric Subjects In general, the adverse reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. In the pediatric trial, the most prevalent adverse reactions were pyrexia (80%), headache (62%), neutropenia (33%), fatigue (30%), anorexia (29%), injection-site erythema (29%) and vomiting (27%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7% (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1%), pain in extremity (1%), headache (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pyrexia (4%). Important adverse reactions that occurred in this subject population were nervousness (7%; 7/107), aggression (3%; 3/107), anger (2%; 2/107), and depression (1%; 1/107). Five subjects received levothyroxine treatment, three with clinical hypothyroidism and two with asymptomatic TSH elevations. Weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron plus ribavirin lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than 3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects while on treatment. Dose modifications of PegIntron and/or ribavirin were required in 25% of subjects due to treatment-related adverse reactions, most commonly for anemia, neutropenia and weight loss. Two subjects (2%; 2/107) discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than or equal to 10% incidence in the pediatric trial subjects are provided in Table 7.

The long-term effects on growth were less in subjects treated for 24 weeks than in those treated for 48 weeks. Twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40% of subjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a >15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment baseline to the end of 5-year follow-up. Eleven percent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13% of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks had a >30 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment baseline to the end of the 5-year follow-up. While observed across all age groups, the highest risk for reduced height at the end of long-term follow-up appeared to be initiation of combination therapy during the years of expected peak growth velocity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Laboratory Values Adult and Pediatric Subjects The adverse reaction profile in Study 3, which compared PegIntron/weight-based ribavirin combination to a PegIntron/flat dose ribavirin regimen, revealed an increased rate of anemia with weight-based dosing (29% vs. 19% for weight-based vs. flat dose regimens, respectively). However, the majority of cases of anemia were mild and responded to dose reductions. Changes in selected laboratory values during treatment in combination with ribavirin treatment are described below. Decreases in hemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Changes in selected laboratory values during therapy are described in Table 8. Most of the changes in laboratory values in the PegIntron/ribavirin trial with pediatrics were mild or moderate. Table 8: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities During Treatment with Ribavirin and PegIntron or Ribavirin and INTRON A in Previously Untreated Subjects * The table summarizes the worst category observed within the period per subject per laboratory test.

In Study 2, hemoglobin levels decreased to less than 11 g/dL in about 30% of subjects. In Study 3, 47% of subjects receiving weight-based dosing of ribavirin and 33% on flat-dose ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 11 g/dL. Reductions in hemoglobin to less than 9 g/dL occurred more frequently in subjects receiving weight-based dosing compared to flat dosing (4% and 2%, respectively). In Study 2, dose modification was required in 9% and 13% of subjects in the PegIntron/ribavirin and INTRON A/ribavirin groups. In Study 4, subjects receiving PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels to between 8.5 to less than 10 g/dL (28%) and to less than 8.5 g/dL (3%), whereas in patients receiving Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus these decreases occurred in 26% and 4% of subjects, respectively. On average, hemoglobin levels became stable by treatment Weeks 4 to 6. The typical pattern observed was a decrease in hemoglobin levels by treatment Week 4 followed by stabilization and a plateau, which was maintained to the end of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Neutrophils . In Study 2, decreases in neutrophil counts were observed in a majority of adult subjects treated with PegIntron/ribavirin (85%) and INTRON A/ribavirin (60%). Severe, potentially life-threatening neutropenia (less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L) occurred in approximately 4% of subjects treated with PegIntron/ribavirin and 2% of subjects treated with INTRON A/ribavirin. Eighteen percent of subjects receiving PegIntron/ribavirin required modification of interferon dosage. Few subjects (less than 1%) required permanent discontinuation of treatment. Neutrophil counts generally returned to pre-treatment levels 4 weeks after cessation of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Platelets . In Study 2, platelet counts decreased to less than 100,000/mm 3 in approximately 20% of subjects treated with PegIntron alone or with ribavirin and in 6% of adult subjects treated with INTRON A/ribavirin. Severe decreases in platelet counts (less than 50,000/mm 3 ) occur in less than 4% of adult subjects. In Study 2, 1% or 3% of subjects required dose modification of INTRON A or PegIntron, respectively. Platelet counts generally returned to pretreatment levels 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Thyroid Function . In Study 2, clinically apparent thyroid disorders occurred among subjects treated with either INTRON A or PegIntron (with or without ribavirin) at a similar incidence (5% for hypothyroidism and 3% for hyperthyroidism). Subjects developed new onset TSH abnormalities while on treatment and during the follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period, 7% of subjects still had abnormal TSH values. Bilirubin and Uric Acid . In Study 2, 10 to 14% of subjects developed hyperbilirubinemia and 33 to 38% developed hyperuricemia in association with hemolysis. Six subjects developed mild to moderate gout. Adverse Reactions with Ribavirin/INTRON A Combination Therapy Adult Subjects In clinical trials, 19% and 6% of previously untreated and relapse subjects, respectively, discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions in the combination arms compared to 13% and 3% in the interferon-only arms. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred in the U.S. trials with incidence 5% or greater are provided by treatment group (see Table 9). In general, the selected treatment-related adverse reactions were reported with lower incidence in the international trials as compared to the U.S. trials, except for asthenia, influenza-like symptoms, nervousness, and pruritus. Pediatric Subjects In clinical trials of 118 pediatric subjects 3 to 16 years of age, 6% discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Dose modifications were required in 30% of subjects, most commonly for anemia and neutropenia. In general, the adverse-reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. Injection site disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in pediatric subjects compared to adult subjects. Conversely, pediatric subjects experienced less fatigue, dyspepsia, arthralgia, insomnia, irritability, impaired concentration, dyspnea, and pruritus compared to adult subjects. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred with incidence 5% or greater among all pediatric subjects who received the recommended dose of ribavirin/INTRON A combination therapy are provided in Table 9.

A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24-week post-treatment period. Long-term data in a limited number of patients, however, suggests that combination therapy may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced final adult height in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Laboratory Values Changes in selected hematologic values (hemoglobin, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) during therapy are described below (see Table 10). Hemoglobin . Hemoglobin decreases among subjects receiving ribavirin therapy began at Week 1, with stabilization by Week 4. In previously untreated subjects treated for 48 weeks, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3.1 g/dL in the U.S. trial and 2.9 g/dL in the international trial. In relapse subjects, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2.8 g/dL in the U.S. trial and 2.6 g/dL in the international trial. Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most subjects. Bilirubin and Uric Acid . Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid, associated with hemolysis, were noted in clinical trials. Most changes were moderate and reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. This observation occurred most frequently in subjects with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert\u2019s syndrome. This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nucleoside analogues: Closely monitor for toxicities. Discontinue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or reduce dose or discontinue interferon, ribavirin or both with worsening toxicities. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Didanosine Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate) is increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities; therefore, coadministration of ribavirin capsules and didanosine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials. 7.2 Nucleoside Analogues Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product). Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV. Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Concomitant use of ribavirin with any of these drugs should be done with caution. 7.3 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P-450 Results of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated little or no cytochrome P-450 enzyme-mediated metabolism of ribavirin, with minimal potential for P-450 enzyme-based drug interactions. No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between INTRON A and ribavirin capsules in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study. 7.4 Azathioprine The use of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate (6-MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatrics: Safety and efficacy in patients less than 3 years old have not been established. ( 8.4 ) Organ transplant recipients: Safety and efficacy not studied. ( 8.6 ) Co-infected patients: Safety and efficacy with HIV or HBV co-infection have not been established. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Ribavirin is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in men whose female partners are pregnant [see Contraindications (4) ] . Based on animal data, ribavirin use in pregnancy may be associated with birth defects. Data from the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Ribavirin is known to accumulate in intracellular components from where it is cleared very slowly. In animal studies, ribavirin exposure was shown to have teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects (see Data) . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available data from the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry on 88 live births from pregnancies in women directly exposed and 98 live births from pregnancies in women indirectly exposed (by a male partner) to ribavirin during pregnancy or during the 6 months prior to pregnancy show a higher rate of birth defects (9.09% and 6.12%, respectively) compared to a background birth defect rate of 2.72% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) birth defects surveillance system. No pattern of birth defects can be identified from these reports. The miscarriage rate was approximately 21%. The current sample size is insufficient for reaching definitive conclusions based on statistical analysis. Trends suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure were not observed. Methodologic limitations of the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease and comorbidities. Animal Data Embryotoxicity/teratogenicity studies with ribavirin were conducted in rats (oral doses of 0.3, 1 and 10 mg/kg on Gestation Days 6 to 15) and rabbits (oral dose of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg on Gestation Days 6 to 18). Ribavirin demonstrated significant embryocidal and teratogenic effects at doses well below the recommended human dose in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ribavirin in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ribavirin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ribavirin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Ribavirin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Ribavirin therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of treatment. Patients should have periodic pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 9-month period after treatment has been stopped [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Contraception Female patients of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 9 months post-therapy. Male patients and their female partners should use effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for the 6-month post-therapy period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Infertility Based on animal data, ribavirin may impair male fertility. In animal studies, these effects were mostly reversible within a few months after drug cessation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ribavirin in combination with PegIntron has not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years. For treatment with ribavirin/INTRON A, evidence of disease progression, such as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load should be considered when deciding to treat a pediatric patient. The benefits of treatment should be weighed against the observed safety findings. Long-term follow-up data in pediatric subjects indicates that ribavirin in combination with PegIntron or with INTRON A may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced height in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% vs. 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. As in adult patients, pediatric patients experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., depression, emotional lability, somnolence), anemia, and neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a study in which rat pups were dosed postnatally with ribavirin at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day, drug-related deaths occurred at 50 mg/kg (at rat pup plasma concentrations below human plasma concentrations at the human therapeutic dose) between study Days 13 and 48. Rat pups dosed from postnatal Days 7 through 63 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth at all doses, which was subsequently manifested as slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length, and bone length. These effects showed evidence of reversibility, and no histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed regarding neurobehavioral or reproductive development. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of ribavirin combination therapy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. Ribavirin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients often have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly. Ribavirin should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) ] . In general, ribavirin capsules should be administered to elderly patients cautiously, starting at the lower end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In clinical trials, elderly subjects had a higher frequency of anemia (67%) than younger patients (28%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.6 Organ Transplant Recipients The safety and efficacy of INTRON A and PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been established. In a small (n=16) single-center, uncontrolled case experience, renal failure in renal allograft recipients receiving interferon alpha and ribavirin combination therapy was more frequent than expected from the center\u2019s previous experience with renal allograft recipients not receiving combination therapy. The relationship of the renal failure to renal allograft rejection is not clear. 8.7 HIV or HBV Co-infection The safety and efficacy of PegIntron/ribavirin and INTRON A/ribavirin for the treatment of patients with HCV co-infected with HIV or HBV have not been established."

Pregnancy Testing Ribavirin therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of treatment. Patients should have periodic pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 9-month period after treatment has been stopped [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Contraception Female patients of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 9 months post-therapy. Male patients and their female partners should use effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for the 6-month post-therapy period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Infertility Based on animal data, ribavirin may impair male fertility. In animal studies, these effects were mostly reversible within a few months after drug cessation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] ."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ribavirin in combination with PegIntron has not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years. For treatment with ribavirin/INTRON A, evidence of disease progression, such as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load should be considered when deciding to treat a pediatric patient. The benefits of treatment should be weighed against the observed safety findings. Long-term follow-up data in pediatric subjects indicates that ribavirin in combination with PegIntron or with INTRON A may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced height in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% vs. 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. As in adult patients, pediatric patients experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., depression, emotional lability, somnolence), anemia, and neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a study in which rat pups were dosed postnatally with ribavirin at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day, drug-related deaths occurred at 50 mg/kg (at rat pup plasma concentrations below human plasma concentrations at the human therapeutic dose) between study Days 13 and 48. Rat pups dosed from postnatal Days 7 through 63 demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth at all doses, which was subsequently manifested as slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length, and bone length. These effects showed evidence of reversibility, and no histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed regarding neurobehavioral or reproductive development."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of ribavirin combination therapy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. Ribavirin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients often have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly. Ribavirin should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) ] . In general, ribavirin capsules should be administered to elderly patients cautiously, starting at the lower end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In clinical trials, elderly subjects had a higher frequency of anemia (67%) than younger patients (28%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

Acute ingestion of up to 20 g of ribavirin capsules, INTRON A ingestion of up to 120 million units, and subcutaneous doses of INTRON A up to 10 times the recommended doses have been reported. Primary effects that have been observed are increased incidence and severity of the adverse reactions related to the therapeutic use of INTRON A and ribavirin. However, hepatic enzyme abnormalities, renal failure, hemorrhage, and myocardial infarction have been reported with administration of single subcutaneous doses of INTRON A that exceed dosing recommendations. There is no specific antidote for INTRON A or ribavirin overdose, and hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective for treatment of overdose of these agents."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ribavirin is an anti-HCV agent [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties in adults are summarized in Table 11. Ribavirin was rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. However, due to first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability averaged 64% (44%). There was a linear relationship between dose and AUC tf (AUC from time zero to last measurable concentration) following single doses of 200 to 1200 mg ribavirin. The relationship between dose and C max was curvilinear, tending to asymptote above single doses of 400 to 600 mg. Upon multiple oral dosing, based on AUC 12hr , a 6-fold accumulation of ribavirin was observed in plasma. Following oral dosing with 600 mg twice daily, steady-state was reached by approximately 4 weeks, with mean steady-state plasma concentrations of 2200 ng/mL (37%). Upon discontinuation of dosing, the mean half-life was 298 (30%) hours, which probably reflects slow elimination from nonplasma compartments. Effect of Antacid on Absorption of Ribavirin : Coadministration of ribavirin capsules with an antacid containing magnesium, aluminum, and simethicone resulted in a 14% decrease in mean ribavirin AUC tf . The clinical relevance of results from this single-dose study is unknown. Table 11: Mean (% CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Ribavirin When Administered Individually to Adults * N=11. \u2020 Data obtained from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study using 14 C labeled ribavirin; N=5. \u2021 N=6. Parameter Ribavirin Single-Dose 600 mg Oral Solution (N=14) Single-Dose 600 mg Capsules (N=12) Multiple-Dose 600 mg Capsules twice daily (N=12) T max (hr) 1.00 (34) 1.7 (46)* 3 (60) C max (ng/mL) 872 (42) 782 (37) 3680 (85) AUC tf (ng\u00b7hr/mL) 14,098 (38) 13,400 (48) 228,000 (25) T 1/2 (hr) 43.6 (47) 298 (30) Apparent Volume of Distribution (L) 2825 (9) \u2020 Apparent Clearance (L/hr) 38.2 (40) Absolute Bioavailability 64% (44) \u2021 Tissue Distribution: Ribavirin transport into nonplasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red blood cells and has been identified to be primarily via an e s -type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the extensive volume of distribution. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion: Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism: (i) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells; and (ii) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite. Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally. After oral administration of 600 mg of 14 C-ribavirin, approximately 61% and 12% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively, in 336 hours. Unchanged ribavirin accounted for 17% of the administered dose. Special Populations: Renal Dysfunction The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were assessed after administration of a single oral dose (400 mg) of ribavirin to non-HCV-infected subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction. The mean AUC tf value was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 10 to 30 mL/min when compared to control subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 90 mL/min). In subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 to 60 mL/min, AUC tf was twofold greater when compared to control subjects. The increased AUC tf appears to be due to reduction of renal and nonrenal clearance in these subjects. Phase 3 efficacy trials included subjects with creatinine clearance values greater than 50 mL/min. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin cannot be accurately predicted in patients with renal dysfunction. Ribavirin is not effectively removed by hemodialysis. Patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min should not be treated with ribavirin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Hepatic Dysfunction The effect of hepatic dysfunction was assessed after a single oral dose of ribavirin (600 mg). The mean AUC tf values were not significantly different in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B, or C) when compared to control subjects. However, the mean C max values increased with severity of hepatic dysfunction and was twofold greater in subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction when compared to control subjects. Elderly Patients Pharmacokinetic evaluations in elderly subjects have not been performed. Gender There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences noted in a single-dose trial of 18 male and 18 female subjects. Pediatric Patients Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin capsules and INTRON A in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 12. The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin and INTRON A (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and pediatric subjects. Complete pharmacokinetic characteristics of ribavirin oral solution have not been determined in pediatric subjects. Ribavirin C min values were similar following administration of ribavirin oral solution or ribavirin capsules during 48 weeks of therapy in pediatric subjects (3 to 16 years of age).

A clinical trial in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C between 3 and 17 years of age was conducted in which pharmacokinetics for PegIntron and ribavirin (capsules and oral solution) were evaluated. In pediatric subjects receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of PegIntron at 60 mcg/m 2 /week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval was predicted to be 58% [90% CI: 141%, 177%] higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 mcg/kg/week. The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin (dose-normalized) in this trial were similar to those reported in a prior study of ribavirin in combination with INTRON A in pediatric subjects and in adults. Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin Both AUC tf and C max increased by 70% when ribavirin capsules were administered with a high-fat meal (841 kcal, 53.8 g fat, 31.6 g protein, and 57.4 g carbohydrate) in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which ribavirin contributes to its antiviral efficacy in the clinic is not fully understood. Ribavirin has direct antiviral activity in cell culture against many RNA viruses. Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical reaction. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The antiviral activity of ribavirin in the HCV replicon is not well understood and has not been defined because of the cellular toxicity of ribavirin. Direct antiviral activity has been observed in cell culture of other RNA viruses. The anti-HCV activity of interferon was demonstrated in cell culture using self-replicating HCV RNA (HCV replicon cells) or HCV infection. Resistance HCV genotypes show wide variability in their response to pegylated recombinant human interferon/ribavirin therapy. Genetic changes associated with the variable response have not been identified. Cross-resistance There is no reported cross-resistance between pegylated/non-pegylated interferons and ribavirin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical Study 1 evaluated PegIntron monotherapy. See PegIntron labeling for information about this trial. 14.1 Ribavirin/PegIntron Combination Therapy Adult Subjects Study 2 A randomized trial compared treatment with two PegIntron/ribavirin regimens [PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly/ribavirin 800 mg orally daily (in divided doses); PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks then 0.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly for 44 weeks/ribavirin 1000 or 1200 mg orally daily (in divided doses)] with INTRON A [3 MIU subcutaneously three times weekly/ribavirin 1000 or 1200 mg orally daily (in divided doses)] in 1,530 adults with chronic hepatitis C. Interferon-na\u00efve subjects were treated for 48 weeks and followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Eligible subjects had compensated liver disease, detectable HCV-RNA, elevated ALT, and liver histopathology consistent with chronic hepatitis. Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (see Table 13). The response rate to the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg and ribavirin 800 mg dose was higher than the response rate to INTRON A/ribavirin (see Table 13). The response rate to PegIntron 1.5\u21920.5 mcg/kg/ribavirin was essentially the same as the response to INTRON A/ ribavirin (data not shown). Table 13: Rates of Response to Combination Treatment \u2013 Study 2 * Serum HCV-RNA was measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory. \u2020 Difference in overall treatment response (PegIntron/ribavirin vs. INTRON A/ribavirin) is 6% with 95% confidence interval of (0.18, 11.63) adjusted for viral genotype and presence of cirrhosis at baseline. Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment.

Subjects with both poor prognostic factors (genotype 1 and high viral load) had a response rate of 30% (78/256) compared to a response rate of 29% (71/247) with INTRON A/ ribavirin combination therapy. Subjects with lower body weight tended to have higher adverse-reaction rates [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] and higher response rates than subjects with higher body weights. Differences in response rates between treatment arms did not substantially vary with body weight. Treatment response rates with PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy were 49% in men and 56% in women. Response rates were lower in African American and Hispanic subjects and higher in Asians compared to Caucasians. Although African Americans had a higher proportion of poor prognostic factors compared to Caucasians, the number of non-Caucasians studied (11% of the total) was insufficient to allow meaningful conclusions about differences in response rates after adjusting for prognostic factors in this trial. Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in 68% of subjects. Compared to baseline, approximately two-thirds of subjects in all treatment groups were observed to have a modest reduction in inflammation. Study 3 In a large United States community-based trial, 4,913 subjects with chronic hepatitis C were randomized to receive PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly in combination with a ribavirin dose of 800 to 1400 mg (weight-based dosing [WBD]) or 800 mg (flat) orally daily (in divided doses) for 24 or 48 weeks based on genotype. Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA (based on an assay with a lower limit of detection of 125 IU/mL) at 24 weeks post-treatment. Treatment with PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg and ribavirin 800 to 1400 mg resulted in a higher sustained virologic response compared to PegIntron in combination with a flat 800 mg daily dose of ribavirin. Subjects weighing greater than 105 kg obtained the greatest benefit with WBD, although a modest benefit was also observed in subjects weighing greater than 85 to 105 kg (see Table 14). The benefit of WBD in subjects weighing greater than 85 kg was observed with HCV genotypes 1 to 3. Insufficient data were available to reach conclusions regarding other genotypes. Use of WBD resulted in an increased incidence of anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Table 14: SVR Rate by Treatment and Baseline Weight - Study 3 * P =0.01, primary efficacy comparison (based on data from subjects weighing 65 kg or higher at baseline and utilizing a logistic regression analysis that includes treatment [WBD or Flat], genotype and presence/absence of advanced fibrosis, in the model). Treatment Group Subject B aseline Weight <65 kg (<143 lb) 65 to 85 kg (143 to 188 lb) >85 to 105 kg (>188 to 231 lb) >105 kg (>231 lb) WBD* 50% (173/348) 45% (449/994) 42% (351/835) 47% (138/292) Flat 51% (173/342) 44% (443/1011) 39% (318/819) 33% (91/272) A total of 1,552 subjects weighing greater than 65 kg in Study 3 had genotype 2 or 3 and were randomized to 24 or 48 weeks of therapy. No additional benefit was observed with the longer treatment duration. Study 4 A large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two PegIntron/ribavirin regimens [PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in combination with ribavirin 800 to 1400 mg PO daily (in two divided doses)] and Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly in combination with Copegus 1000 to 1200 mg PO daily (in two divided doses) in 3,070 treatment-na\u00efve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. In this trial, lack of early virologic response (undetectable HCV-RNA or greater than or equal to 2 log 10 reduction from baseline) by treatment Week 12 was the criterion for discontinuation of treatment. SVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA (Roche COBAS TaqMan assay, a lower limit of quantitation of 27 IU/mL) at 24 weeks post-treatment (see Table 15). Table 15: SVR Rate by Treatment \u2013 Study 4 % (number) of Subjects PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg/ Ribavirin PegIntron 1 mcg/kg/ Ribavirin Pegasys 180 mcg/Copegus 40 (406/1019) 38 (386/1016) 41 (423/1035) Overall SVR rates were similar among the three treatment groups. Regardless of treatment group, SVR rates were lower in subjects with poor prognostic factors. Subjects with poor prognostic factors randomized to PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin or Pegasys/Copegus, however, achieved higher SVR rates compared to similar subjects randomized to PegIntron 1 mcg/kg/ribavirin. For the PegIntron 1.5 mcg/kg and ribavirin dose, SVR rates for subjects with and without the following prognostic factors were as follows: cirrhosis (10% vs. 42%), normal ALT levels (32% vs. 42%), baseline viral load greater than 600,000 IU/mL (35% vs. 61%), 40 years of age and older (38% vs. 50%), and African American race (23% vs. 44%). In subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment Week 12 who received PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin, the SVR rate was 81% (328/407). Study 5 - Ribavirin/PegIntron Combination Therapy in Prior Treatment Failures In a noncomparative trial, 2,293 subjects with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were re-treated with PegIntron, 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin. Eligible subjects included prior nonresponders (subjects who were HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum 12 weeks of treatment) and prior relapsers (subjects who were HCV-RNA negative at the end of a minimum 12 weeks of treatment and subsequently relapsed after post-treatment follow-up). Subjects who were negative at Week 12 were treated for 48 weeks and followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (measured using a research-based test, limit of detection 125 IU/mL). The overall response rate was 22% (497/2293) (99% CI: 19.5, 23.9). Subjects with the following characteristics were less likely to benefit from re-treatment: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection. The re-treatment sustained virologic response rates by baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 16.

In this trial, 1,470 (64%) subjects did not achieve an undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment Week 12, and were offered enrollment into long-term treatment trials, due to an inadequate treatment response. Of the 823 (36%) subjects who were HCV-RNA undetectable at treatment Week 12, those infected with genotype 1 had an SVR of 48% (245/507), with a range of responses by fibrosis scores (F4-F2) of 39 to 55%. Subjects infected with genotype 2/3 who were HCV-RNA undetectable at treatment Week 12 had an overall SVR of 70% (196/281), with a range of responses by fibrosis scores (F4-F2) of 60 to 83%. For all genotypes, higher fibrosis scores were associated with a decreased likelihood of achieving SVR. Pediatric Subjects Previously untreated pediatric subjects 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day and PegIntron 60 mcg/m 2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All subjects were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 subjects received treatment, of which 52% were female, 89% were Caucasian, and 67% were infected with HCV Genotype 1. Subjects infected with Genotypes 1, 4 or Genotype 3 with HCV-RNA greater than or equal to 600,000 IU/mL received 48 weeks of therapy while those infected with Genotype 2 or Genotype 3 with HCV-RNA less than 600,000 IU/mL received 24 weeks of therapy. The trial results are summarized in Table 17.

The international trial did not contain a 24-week INTRON A and placebo treatment arm. The U.S. trial enrolled 912 subjects who, at baseline, were 67% male, 89% Caucasian with a mean Knodell HAI score (I+II+III) of 7.5, and 72% genotype 1. The international trial, conducted in Europe, Israel, Canada, and Australia, enrolled 799 subjects (65% male, 95% Caucasian, mean Knodell score 6.8, and 58% genotype 1).

Among subjects with HCV Genotype 1 treated with ribavirin/INTRON A therapy who achieved HCV-RNA below the detection limit of the research-based assay by 24 weeks, those randomized to 48 weeks of treatment had higher virologic responses compared to those in the 24-week treatment group. There was no observed increase in response rates for subjects with HCV non-genotype 1 randomized to ribavirin/INTRON A therapy for 48 weeks compared to 24 weeks. Relapse Subjects Subjects with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) who had relapsed following one or two courses of interferon therapy (defined as abnormal serum ALT levels) were enrolled into two multicenter, double-blind trials (U.S. and international) and randomized to receive ribavirin 1200 mg/day (1000 mg/day for subjects weighing \u226475 kg) and INTRON A 3 MIU three times weekly or INTRON A and placebo for 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of off-therapy follow-up. The U.S. trial enrolled 153 subjects who, at baseline, were 67% male, 92% Caucasian with a mean Knodell HAI score (I+II+III) of 6.8, and 58% genotype 1. The international trial, conducted in Europe, Israel, Canada, and Australia, enrolled 192 subjects (64% male, 95% Caucasian, mean Knodell score 6.6, and 56% genotype 1). Trial results are summarized in Table 19. Table 19: Virologic and Histologic Responses: Relapse Subjects* * Number (%) of subjects. \u2020 Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research-based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period. \u2021 Defined as post-treatment (end of follow-up) minus pretreatment liver biopsy Knodell HAI score (I+II+III) improvement of greater than or equal to 2 points.

Pediatric Subjects Pediatric subjects 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day and INTRON A 3 MIU/m 2 three times weekly for 48 weeks followed by 24 weeks of off-therapy follow-up. A total of 118 subjects received treatment, of which 57% were male, 80% Caucasian, and 78% genotype 1. Subjects less than 5 years of age received ribavirin oral solution and those 5 years of age or older received either ribavirin oral solution or capsules. Trial results are summarized in Table 20. Table 20: Virologic Response: Previously Untreated Pediatric Subjects* * Number (%) of subjects. \u2020 Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research-based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period.

Subjects with both poor prognostic factors (genotype 1 and high viral load) had a response rate of 26% (13/50)."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In cell cultures the inhibitory activity of ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is selective. The mechanism of action is unknown. Reversal of the in vitro antiviral activity by guanosine or xanthosine suggests ribavirin may act as an analogue of these cellular metabolites. Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 mcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown. Immunologic Effects Neutralizing antibody responses to RSV were decreased in aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP-treated infants compared to placebo-treated infants. 3 One study also showed that RSV-specific IgE antibody in bronchial secretions was decreased in patients treated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. In rats, ribavirin administration resulted in lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Humoral immunity was reduced in guinea pigs and ferrets. Cellular immunity was also mildly depressed in animal studies. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Assay for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u03bcM. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u03bc M. The bioavailability of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations manyfold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus, and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined. Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen in the lungs following exposure at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown."

      "Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 mcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown."

      "Pharmacokinetics Assay for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u03bcM. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u03bc M. The bioavailability of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations manyfold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus, and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined."

      "Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen in the lungs following exposure at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV. Treatment early in the course of severe lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection should be treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. The vast majority of infants and children with RSV infection have disease that is mild, self-limited, and does not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. Many children with mild lower respiratory tract involvement will require shorter hospitalization than would be required for a full course of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol (3 to 7 days) and should not be treated with the drug. Thus the decision to treat with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be based on the severity of the RSV infection. The presence of an underlying condition such as prematurity, immunosuppression or cardiopulmonary disease may increase the severity of clinical manifestations and complications of RSV infection. Use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in patients requiring mechanical ventilator assistance should be undertaken only by physicians and support staff familiar with this mode of administration and the specific ventilator being used (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Diagnosis RSV infection should be documented by a rapid diagnostic method such as demonstration of viral antigen in respiratory tract secretions by immunofluorescence 3,4 or ELISA 5 before or during the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection. Non-culture antigen detection techniques may have false positive or false negative results. Assessment of the clinical situation, the time of year and other parameters may warrant reevaluation of the laboratory diagnosis. Description of Studies Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants In two placebo-controlled trials in infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment had a therapeutic effect, as judged by the reduction in severity of clinical manifestations of disease by treatment day 3. 3,4 Treatment was most effective when instituted within the first 3 days of clinical illness. Virus titers in respiratory secretions were also significantly reduced with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in one of these original studies. 4 Additional controlled studies conducted since these initial trials of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in the treatment of RSV infection have supported these data. Mechanically Ventilated Infants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP at the recommended dose was conducted in 28 infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by documented RSV infection. 6 Mean age was 1.4 months (SD, 1.7 months). Seven patients had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection and 21 were previously normal. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment significantly decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation required (4.9 vs. 9.9 days, p=0.01) and duration of required supplemental oxygen (8.7 vs. 13.5 days, p=0.01). Intensive patient management and monitoring techniques were employed in this study. These included endotracheal tube suctioning every 1 to 2 hours; recording of proximal airway pressure, ventilatory rate, and F l O 2 every hour; and arterial blood gas monitoring every 2 to 6 hours. To reduce the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation and ventilator malfunction, heated wire tubing, two bacterial filters connected in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator (with filter changes every 4 hours), and water column pressure release valves to monitor internal ventilator pressures were used in connecting ventilator circuits to the SPAG \u00ae -2. Employing these techniques, no technical difficulties with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration were encountered during the study. Adverse events consisted of bacterial pneumonia in one case, staphylococcus bacteremia in one case and two cases of post-extubation stridor. None were felt to be related to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Therefore, although clinical studies have not been performed, it should be assumed that Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. Studies in which the drug has been administered systemically demonstrate that ribavirin is concentrated in the red blood cells and persists for the life of the erythrocyte."

      "WARNINGS SUDDEN DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATION OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP USE IN INFANTS. Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and reinstituted only with extreme caution, continuous monitoring, and consideration of concomitant administration of bronchodilators. Use with Mechanical Ventilators USE OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP IN PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY BY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH THIS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE SPECIFIC VENTILATOR BEING USED. Strict attention must be paid to procedures that have been shown to minimize the accumulation of drug precipitate, which can result in mechanical ventilator dysfunction and associated increased pulmonary pressures. These procedures include the use of bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit with frequent changes (every 4 hours), water column pressure release valves to indicate elevated ventilator pressures, frequent monitoring of these devices and verification that ribavirin crystals have not accumulated within the ventilator circuitry, and frequent suctioning and monitoring of the patient (see Description of Studies ). Those administering aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in conjunction with mechanical ventilator use should be thoroughly familiar with detailed descriptions of these procedures as outlined in the SPAG-2 Instructions for Use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). Drug Interactions Clinical studies of interactions of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with other drugs commonly used to treat infants with RSV infections, such as digoxin, bronchodilators, other antiviral agents, antibiotics or anti-metabolites, have not been conducted. Interference by Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with laboratory tests has not been evaluated. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin increased the incidence of cell transformations and mutations in mouse Balb/c 3T3 (fibroblasts) and L5178Y (lymphoma) cells at concentrations of 0.015 and 0.03-5.0 mg/mL, respectively (without metabolic activation). Modest increases in mutation rates (3-4x) were observed at concentrations between 3.75-10.0 mg/mL in L5178Y cells in vitro with the addition of a metabolic activation fraction. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ribavirin was clastogenic at intravenous doses of 20-200 mg/kg, (estimated human equivalent of 1.67-16.7 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult). Ribavirin was not mutagenic in a dominant lethal assay in rats at intraperitoneal doses between 50-200 mg/kg when administered for 5 days (estimated human equivalent of 7.14-28.6 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). In vivo carcinogenicity studies with ribavirin are incomplete. However, results of a chronic feeding study with ribavirin in rats, at doses of 16-100 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.3-14.3 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult), suggest that ribavirin may induce benign mammary, pancreatic, pituitary and adrenal tumors. Preliminary results of two oral gavage oncogenicity studies in the mouse and rat (18-24 months; doses of 20-75 and 10-40 mg/kg/day, respectively [estimated human equivalent of 1.67-6.25 and 1.43-5.71 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult]) are inconclusive as to the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin (see Pharmacokinetics ). However, these studies have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages in mice) and retinal degeneration (in rats). Impairment of Fertility The fertility of ribavirin-treated animals (male or female) has not been fully investigated. However, in the mouse, administration of ribavirin at doses between 35-150 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.92-12.5 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult) resulted in significant seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm concentrations, and increased numbers of sperm with abnormal morphology. Partial recovery of sperm production was apparent 3-6 months following dose cessation. In several additional toxicology studies, ribavirin has been shown to cause testicular lesions (tubular atrophy) in adult rats at oral dose levels as low as 16 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.29 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). Lower doses were not tested. The reproductive capacity of treated male animals has not been studied. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Teratogenic effects were evident after single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater in the hamster, and after daily oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the rabbit and rat, respectively (estimated human equivalent doses of 0.12 and 0.14 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult). Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced. Ribavirin caused embryolethality in the rabbit at daily oral dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were evident in the rabbit and rat administered daily oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively with estimated human equivalent doses of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment (see Pharmacokinetics ). These doses are considered to define the No Observable Teratogenic Effects Level (NOTEL) for ribavirin in the rabbit and rat. Following oral administration of ribavirin in the pregnant rat (1.0 mg/kg) and rabbit (0.3 mg/kg), mean plasma levels of drug ranged from 0.10-0.20 \u03bc M [0.024-0.049 \u03bc /mL] at 1 hour after dosing, to undetectable levels at 24 hours. At 1 hour following the administration of 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg in the rat and rabbit (NOTEL), respectively, mean plasma levels of drug in both species were near or below the limit of detection (0.05 \u03bc M; see Pharmacokinetics ). Although clinical studies have not been performed, Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. As noted previously, ribavirin is concentrated in red blood cells and persists for the life of the cell. Thus the terminal half-life for the systemic elimination of ribavirin is essentially that of the half-life of circulating erythrocytes. The minimum interval following exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP before pregnancy may be safely initiated is unknown (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and Information for Health Care Personnel ). Lactation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP has been shown to be toxic to lactating animals and their offspring. It is not known if Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is excreted in human milk. Information for Health Care Personnel Health care workers directly providing care to patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be aware that ribavirin has been shown to be teratogenic in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Although no reports of teratogenesis in offspring of mothers who were exposed to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP during pregnancy have been confirmed, no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Studies of environmental exposure in treatment settings have shown that the drug can disperse into the immediate bedside area during routine patient care activities with highest ambient levels closest to the patient and extremely low levels outside of the immediate bedside area. Adverse reactions resulting from actual occupational exposure in adults are described below (see Adverse Events in Health Care Workers ). Some studies have documented ambient drug concentrations at the bedside that could potentially lead to systemic exposures above those considered safe for exposure during pregnancy (1/1000 of the NOTEL dose in the most sensitive animal species). 7, 8, 9 A 1992 study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrated measurable urine levels of ribavirin in health care workers exposed to aerosol in the course of direct patient care. 7 Levels were lowest in workers caring for infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with mechanical ventilation and highest in those caring for patients being administered the drug via an oxygen tent or hood. This study employed a more sensitive assay to evaluate ribavirin levels in urine than was available for several previous studies of environmental exposure that failed to detect measurable ribavirin levels in exposed workers. Creatinine adjusted urine levels in the NIOSH study ranged from less than 0.001 to 0.140 \u03bc M of ribavirin per gram of creatinine in exposed workers. However, the relationship between urinary ribavirin levels in exposed workers, plasma levels in animal studies, and the specific risk of teratogenesis in exposed pregnant women is unknown. It is good practice to avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to chemicals wherever possible. Hospitals are encouraged to conduct training programs to minimize potential occupational exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Health care workers who are pregnant should consider avoiding direct care of patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. If close patient contact cannot be avoided, precautions to limit exposure should be taken. These include administration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in negative pressure rooms; adequate room ventilation (at least six air exchanges per hour); the use of scavenging devices; turning off the SPAG-2 device for 5 to 10 minutes prior to prolonged patient contact; and wearing appropriately fitted respirator masks. Surgical masks do not provide adequate filtration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP particles. Further information is available from NIOSH's Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch and additional recommendations have been published in an Aerosol Consensus Statement by the American Respiratory Care Foundation and the American Association for Respiratory Care. 10"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The description of adverse reactions is based on events from clinical studies (approximately 200 patients) conducted prior to 1986, and the controlled trial of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP conducted in 1989-1990. Additional data from spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse events in individual patients have been available since 1986. Deaths Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections). Several cases have been characterized as \"possibly related\" to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP by the treating physician; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug. Several other cases have been attributed to mechanical ventilator malfunction in which Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation within the ventilator apparatus led to excessively high pulmonary pressures and diminished oxygenation. In these cases the monitoring procedures described in the current package insert were not employed (see Description of Studies , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Pulmonary function significantly deteriorated during aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment in six of six adults with chronic obstructive lung disease and in four of six asthmatic adults. Dyspnea and chest soreness were also reported in the latter group. Minor abnormalities in pulmonary function were also seen in healthy adult volunteers. In the original study population of approximately 200 infants who received aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with lifethreatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. The role of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in these events is indeterminate. Since the drug's approval in 1986, additional reports of similar serious, though non-fatal, events have been filed infrequently. Events associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have included the following: Pulmonary Worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, hypoventilation, cyanosis, dyspnea, bacterial pneumonia, pneumothorax, apnea, atelectasis and ventilator dependence. Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia and digitalis toxicity. Bigeminy, bradycardia and tachycardia have been described in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation experienced serious difficulties, due to inadequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (\"rain out\") has also been noted. Measures to avoid these complications should be followed carefully (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hematologic Although anemia was not reported with use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in controlled clinical trials, most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 to 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Anemia has been shown to occur frequently with experimental oral and intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in humans. Also, cases of anemia (type unspecified), reticulocytosis and hemolytic anemia associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have been reported through post-marketing reporting systems. All have been reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Other Rash and conjunctivitis have been associated with the use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. These usually resolve within hours of discontinuing therapy. Seizures and asthenia associated with experimental intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP therapy have also been reported. Adverse Events in Health Care Workers Studies of environmental exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in health care workers administering care to patients receiving the drug have not detected adverse signs or symptoms related to exposure. However, 152 health care workers have reported experiencing adverse events through post-marketing surveillance. Nearly all were in individuals providing direct care to infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Of 358 events from these 152 individual health care worker reports, the most common signs and symptoms were headache (51% of reports), conjunctivitis (32%), and rhinitis, nausea, rash, dizziness, pharyngitis, or lacrimation (10-20% each). Several cases of bronchospasm and/or chest pain were also reported, usually in individuals with known underlying reactive airway disease. Several case reports of damage to contact lenses after prolonged close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have also been reported. Most signs and symptoms reported as having occurred in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of discontinuing close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (also see Information for Health Care Personnel ). The symptoms of RSV in adults can include headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat and/or cough, fever, hoarseness, nasal congestion and wheezing, although RSV infections in adults are typically mild and transient. Such infections represent a potential hazard to uninfected hospital patients. It is unknown whether certain symptoms cited in reports from health care workers were due to exposure to the drug or infection with RSV. Hospitals should implement appropriate infection control procedures.

AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH ANY OTHER AEROSOL GENERATING DEVICE. The recommended treatment regimen is 20 mg/mL Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP as the starting solution in the drug reservoir of the SPAG-2 unit, with continuous aerosol administration for 12-18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days. Using the recommended drug concentration of 20 mg/mL the average aerosol concentration for a 12 hour delivery period would be 190 mcg/L of air. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should not be administered in a mixture for combined aerosolization or simultaneously with other aerosolized medications. Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be delivered to an infant oxygen hood from the SPAG \u00ae -2 aerosol generator. Administration by face mask or oxygen tent may be necessary if a hood cannot be employed (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). However, the volume and condensation area are larger in a tent and this may alter delivery dynamics of the drug. Mechanically Ventilated Infants The recommended dose and administration schedule for infants who require mechanical ventilation is the same as for those who do not. Either a pressure or volume cycle ventilator may be used in conjunction with the SPAG-2. In either case, patients should have their endotracheal tubes suctioned every 1-2 hours, and their pulmonary pressures monitored frequently (every 2-4 hours). For both pressure and volume ventilators, heated wire connective tubing and bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the system (which must be changed frequently, i.e., every 4 hours) must be used to minimize the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation in the system and the subsequent risk of ventilator dysfunction. Water column pressure release valves should be used in the ventilator circuit for pressure cycled ventilators, and may be utilized with volume cycled ventilators (see SPAG-2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS). Method of Preparation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is supplied as 6 grams of lyophilized powder per 100 mL vial for aerosol administration only.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In cell cultures the inhibitory activity of ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is selective. The mechanism of action is unknown. Reversal of the in vitro antiviral activity by guanosine or xanthosine suggests ribavirin may act as an analogue of these cellular metabolites. Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 \u03bcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown. Immunologic Effects Neutralizing antibody responses to RSV were decreased in aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treated infants compared to placebo treated infants. 3 One study also showed that RSV-specific IgE antibody in bronchial secretions was decreased in patients treated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. In rats, ribavirin administration resulted in lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Humoral immunity was reduced in guinea pigs and ferrets. Cellular immunity was also mildly depressed in animal studies. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Assay for ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u00b5M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u00b5M. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u00b5M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u00b5M. The bioavailability of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations many fold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined. Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen in the lungs following exposure at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus. Treatment early in the course of severe lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection should be treated with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. The vast majority of infants and children with RSV infection have disease that is mild, self-limited, and does not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. Many children with mild lower respiratory tract involvement will require shorter hospitalization than would be required for a full course of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP aerosol (3 to 7 days) and should not be treated with the drug. Thus the decision to treat with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be based on the severity of the RSV infection. The presence of an underlying condition such as prematurity, immunosuppression or cardiopulmonary disease may increase the severity of clinical manifestations and complications of RSV infection. Use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in patients requiring mechanical ventilator assistance should be undertaken only by physicians and support staff familiar with this mode of administration and the specific ventilator being used (see WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Diagnosis RSV infection should be documented by a rapid diagnostic method such as demonstration of viral antigen in respiratory tract secretions by immunofluorescence 3,4 or ELISA 5 before or during the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection. Non-culture antigen detection techniques may have false positive or false negative results. Assessment of the clinical situation, the time of year and other parameters may warrant reevaluation of the laboratory diagnosis. Description of Studies Non-Mechanically-Ventilated Infants: In two placebo controlled trials in infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment had a therapeutic effect, as judged by the reduction in severity of clinical manifestations of disease by treatment day 3. 3,4 Treatment was most effective when instituted within the first 3 days of clinical illness. Virus titers in respiratory secretions were also significantly reduced with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in one of these original studies. 4 Additional controlled studies conducted since these initial trials of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in the treatment of RSV infection have supported these data. Mechanically-Ventilated Infants : A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP at the recommended dose was conducted in 28 infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by documented RSV infection. 6 Mean age was 1.4 months (SD, 1.7 months). Seven patients had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection and 21 were previously normal. Aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment significantly decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation required (4.9 vs. 9.9 days, p=0.01) and duration of required supplemental oxygen (8.7 vs. 13.5 days, p=0.01). Intensive patient management and monitoring techniques were employed in this study. These included endotracheal tube suctioning every 1 to 2 hours; recording of proximal airway pressure, ventilatory rate, and F l O 2 every hour; and arterial blood gas monitoring every 2 to 6 hours. To reduce the risk of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation and ventilator malfunction, heated wire tubing, two bacterial filters connected in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator (with filter changes every 4 hours), and water column pressure release valves to monitor internal ventilator pressures were used in connecting ventilator circuits to the SPAG-2. Employing these techniques, no technical difficulties with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administration were encountered during the study. Adverse events consisted of bacterial pneumonia in one case, staphyloccus bacteremia in one case and two cases of post-extubation stridor. None were felt to be related to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP administration."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Therefore, although clinical studies have not been performed, it should be assumed that ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. Studies in which the drug has been administered systemically demonstrate that ribavirin is concentrated in the red blood cells and persists for the life of the erythrocyte."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS SUDDEN DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATION OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP USE IN INFANTS. Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and reinstituted only with extreme caution, continuous monitoring, and consideration of concomitant administration of bronchodilators. Use with Mechanical Ventilators USE OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP IN PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY BY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH THIS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE SPECIFIC VENTILATOR BEING USED. Strict attention must be paid to procedures that have been shown to minimize the accumulation of drug precipitate, which can result in mechanical ventilator dysfunction and associated increased pulmonary pressures. These procedures include the use of bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit with frequent changes (every 4 hours), water column pressure release valves to indicate elevated ventilator pressures, frequent monitoring of these devices and verification that ribavirin crystals have not accumulated within the ventilator circuitry, and frequent suctioning and monitoring of the patient (see Clinical Studies). Those administering aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in conjunction with mechanical ventilator use should be thoroughly familiar with detailed descriptions of these procedures as outlined in the SPAG-2 manual."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory syncytial virus require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status (see SPAG-2 manual). Drug Interactions Clinical studies of interactions of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with other drugs commonly used to treat infants with RSV infections, such as digoxin, bronchodilators, other antiviral agents, antibiotics or anti-metabolites, have not been conducted. Interference by ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with laboratory tests has not been evaluated. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin increased the incidence of cell transformations and mutations in mouse Balb/c 3T3 (fibroblasts) and L5178Y (lymphoma) cells at concentrations of 0.015 and 0.03-5.0 mg/mL, respectively (without metabolic activation). Modest increases in mutation rates (3-4x) were observed at concentrations between 3.75-10.0 mg/mL in L5178Y cells in vitro with the addition of a metabolic activation fraction. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ribavirin was clastogenic at intravenous doses of 20-200 mg/kg, (estimated human equivalent of 1.67-16.7 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult). Ribavirin was not mutagenic in a dominant lethal assay in rats at intraperitoneal doses between 50-200 mg/kg when administered for 5 days (estimated human equivalent of 7.14-28.6 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). In vivo carcinogenicity studies with ribavirin are incomplete. However, results of a chronic feeding study with ribavirin in rats, at doses of 16-100 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.3-14.3 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult), suggest that ribavirin may induce benign mammary, pancreatic, pituitary and adrenal tumors. Preliminary results of 2 oral gavage oncogenicity studies in the mouse and rat (18-24 months; doses of 20-75 and 10-40 mg/kg/day, respectively [estimated human equivalent of 1.67-6.25 and 1.43-5.71 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult]) are inconclusive as to the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin (see Pharmacokinetics ). However, these studies have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages in mice) and retinal degeneration (in rats). Impairment of Fertility The fertility of ribavirin-treated animals (male or female) has not been fully investigated. However, in the mouse, administration of ribavirin at doses between 35-150 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.92-12.5 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult) resulted in significant seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm concentrations, and increased numbers of sperm with abnormal morphology. Partial recovery of sperm production was apparent 3-6 months following dose cessation. In several additional toxicology studies, ribavirin has been shown to cause testicular lesions (tubular atrophy) in adult rats at oral dose levels as low as 16 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.29 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). Lower doses were not tested. The reproductive capacity of treated male animals has not been studied. Pregnancy: Category X Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Teratogenic effects were evident after single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater in the hamster, and after daily oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the rabbit and rat, respectively (estimated human equivalent doses of 0.12 and 0.14 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult). Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced. Ribavirin caused embryolethality in the rabbit at daily oral dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were evident in the rabbit and rat administered daily oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively with estimated human equivalent doses of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment (see Pharmacokinetics ). These doses are considered to define the \"No Observable Teratogenic Effects Level\" (NOTEL) for ribavirin in the rabbit and rat. Following oral administration of ribavirin in the pregnant rat (1.0 mg/kg) and rabbit (0.3 mg/kg), mean plasma levels of drug ranged from 0.10-0.20 \u00b5M[0.024-0.049 \u00b5/mL] at 1 hour after dosing, to undetectable levels at 24 hours. At 1 hour following the administration of 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg in the rat and rabbit (NOTEL), respectively, mean plasma levels of drug in both species were near or below the limit of detection (0.05 \u00b5M; see Pharmacokinetics ). Although clinical studies have not been performed, ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. As noted previously, ribavirin is concentrated in red blood cells and persists for the life of the cell. Thus the terminal half-life for the systemic elimination of ribavirin is essentially that of the half-life of circulating erythrocytes. The minimum interval following exposure to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP before pregnancy may be safely initiated is unknown (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and Information for Health Care Personnel ). Nursing Mothers Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP has been shown to be toxic to lactating animals and their offspring. It is not known if ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is excreted in human milk. Information for Health Care Personnel Health care workers directly providing care to patients receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be aware that ribavirin has been shown to be teratogenic in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Although no reports of teratogenesis in offspring of mothers who were exposed to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP during pregnancy have been confirmed, no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Studies of environmental exposure in treatment settings have shown that the drug can disperse into the immediate bedside area during routine patient care activities with highest ambient levels closest to the patient and extremely low levels outside of the immediate bedside area. Adverse reactions resulting from actual occupational exposure in adults are described below (see Adverse Events in Health Care Workers ). Some studies have documented ambient drug concentrations at the bedside that could potentially lead to systemic exposures above those considered safe for exposure during pregnancy (1/1000 of the NOTEL dose in the most sensitive animal species). 7,8,9 A 1992 study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrated measurable urine levels of ribavirin in health care workers exposed to aerosol in the course of direct patient care. 7 Levels were lowest in workers caring for infants receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP with mechanical ventilation and highest in those caring for patients being administered the drug via an oxygen tent or hood. This study employed a more sensitive assay to evaluate ribavirin levels in urine than was available for several previous studies of environmental exposure that failed to detect measurable ribavirin levels in exposed workers. Creatinine adjusted urine levels in the NIOSH study ranged from less than 0.001 to 0.140 \u00b5M of ribavirin per gram of creatinine in exposed workers. However, the relationship between urinary ribavirin levels in exposed workers, plasma levels in animal studies, and the specific risk of teratogenesis in exposed pregnant women is unknown. It is good practice to avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to chemicals wherever possible. Hospitals are encouraged to conduct training programs to minimize potential occupational exposure to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. Health care workers who are pregnant should consider avoiding direct care of patients receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. If close patient contact cannot be avoided, precautions to limit exposure should be taken. These include administration of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in negative pressure rooms; adequate room ventilation (at least six air exchanges per hour); the use of aerosol scavenging devices; turning off the SPAG-2 device for 5 to 10 minutes prior to prolonged patient contact; and wearing appropriately fitted respirator masks. Surgical masks do not provide adequate filtration of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP particles. Further information is available from NIOSH's Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch and additional recommendations have been published in an Aerosol Consensus Statement by the American Respiratory Care Foundation and the American Association for Respiratory Care. 10"

Additional data from spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse events in individual patients have been available since 1986. Deaths Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP (12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections). Several cases have been characterized as \"possibly related\" to ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP by the treating physician; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug. Several other cases have been attributed to mechanical ventilator malfunction in which ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation within the ventilator apparatus led to excessively high pulmonary pressures and diminished oxygenation. In these cases the monitoring procedures described in the current package insert were not employed (see Description of Studies , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Pulmonary function significantly deteriorated during aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP treatment in six of six adults with chronic obstructive lung disease and in four of six asthmatic adults. Dyspnea and chest soreness were also reported in the latter group. Minor abnormalities in pulmonary function were also seen in healthy adult volunteers. In the original study population of approximately 200 infants who received aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP, several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with life-threatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. The role of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in these events is indeterminate. Since the drug's approval in 1986, additional reports of similar serious, though non-fatal, events have been filed infrequently. Events associated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP use have included the following: Pulmonary: Worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, hypoventilation, cyanosis, dyspnea, bacterial pneumonia, pneumothorax, apnea, atelectasis and ventilator dependence. Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia and digitalis toxicity. Bigeminy, bradycardia and tachycardia have been described in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation experienced serious difficulties, due to inadequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (\"rain out\") has also been noted. Measures to avoid these complications should be followed carefully (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hematologic Although anemia was not reported with use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in controlled clinical trials, most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 to 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Anemia has been shown to occur frequently with experimental oral and intravenous ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in humans. Also, cases of anemia (type unspecified), reticulocytosis and hemolytic anemia associated with aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP use have been reported through post-marketing reporting systems. All have been reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Other Rash and conjunctivitis have been associated with the use of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. These usually resolve within hours of discontinuing therapy. Seizures and asthenia associated with experimental intravenous ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP therapy have also been reported. Adverse Events in Health Care Workers Studies of environmental exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP in health care workers administering care to patients receiving the drug have not detected adverse signs or symptoms related to exposure. However, 152 health care workers have reported experiencing adverse events through post-marketing surveillance. Nearly all were in individuals providing direct care to infants receiving aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP. Of 358 events from these 152 individual health care worker reports, the most common signs and symptoms were headache (51% of reports), conjunctivitis (32%), and rhinitis, nausea, rash, dizziness, pharyngitis, or lacrimation (10-20% each). Several cases of bronchospasm and/or chest pain were also reported, usually in individuals with known underlying reactive airway disease. Several case reports of damage to contact lenses after prolonged close exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP have also been reported. Most signs and symptoms reported as having occurred in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of discontinuing close exposure to aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP (also see Information for Health Care Personnel ). The symptoms of RSV in adults can include headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat and/or cough, fever, hoarseness, nasal congestion and wheezing, although RSV infections in adults are typically mild and transient. Such infections represent a potential hazard to uninfected hospital patients. It is unknown whether certain symptoms cited in reports from health care workers were due to exposure to the drug or infection with RSV. Hospitals should implement appropriate infection control procedures."

      "OVERDOSAGE No overdosage with ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP by aerosol administration has been reported in humans. The LD 50 in mice is 2 g orally and is associated with hypoactivity and gastrointestinal symptoms (estimated human equivalent dose of 0.17 g/kg, based on body surface area conversion). The mean plasma half-life after administration of aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP for pediatric patients is 9.5 hours. ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is concentrated and persists in red blood cells for the life of the erythrocyte (see Pharmacokinetics )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BEFORE USE, READ THOROUGHLY THE VALEANT SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR SPAG-2 OPERATOR'S MANUAL FOR SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS. AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED WITH ANY OTHER AEROSOL GENERATING DEVICE. The recommended treatment regimen is 20 mg/mL ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP as the starting solution in the drug reservoir of the SPAG-2 unit, with continuous aerosol administration for 12-18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days. Using the recommended drug concentration of 20 mg/mL the average aerosol concentration for a 12 hour delivery period would be 190 micrograms/liter of air. Aerosolized ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should not be administered in a mixture for combined aerosolization or simultaneously with other aerosolized medications. Non-mechanically ventilated infants Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP should be delivered to an infant oxygen hood from the SPAG-2 aerosol generator. Administration by face mask or oxygen tent may be necessary if a hood cannot be employed (see SPAG-2 manual). However, the volume and condensation area are larger in a tent and this may alter delivery dynamics of the drug. Mechanically Ventilated Infants The recommended dose and administration schedule for infants who require mechanical ventilation is the same as for those who do not. Either a pressure or volume cycle ventilator may be used in conjunction with the SPAG-2. In either case, patients should have their endotracheal tubes suctioned every 1-2 hours, and their pulmonary pressures monitored frequently (every 2-4 hours). For both pressure and volume ventilators, heated wire connective tubing and bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the system (which must be changed frequently, i.e., every 4 hours) must be used to minimize the risk of ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP precipitation in the system and the subsequent risk of ventilator dysfunction. Water column pressure release valves should be used in the ventilator circuit for pressure cycled ventilators, and may be utilized with volume cycled ventilators (SEE SPAG-2 MANUAL FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS). Method of Preparation Ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP is supplied as 6 grams of lyophilized powder per 100 mL vial for aerosol administration only. By sterile technique, reconstitute drug with a minimum of 75 mL of sterile water for injection, USP or sterile water for inhalation, USP in the original 100 mL glass vial. Shake well . Transfer to the clean, sterilized 500 mL SPAG-2 reservoir and further dilute to a final volume of 300 mL with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Inhalation. The final concentration should be 20 mg/mL. Important: This water should NOT have had any antimicrobial agent or other substance added. The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Solutions that have been placed in the SPAG-2 unit should be discarded at least every 24 hours and when the liquid level is low before adding newly reconstituted solution."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In cell cultures the inhibitory activity of ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is selective. The mechanism of action is unknown. Reversal of the in vitro antiviral activity by guanosine or xanthosine suggests ribavirin may act as an analogue of these cellular metabolites. Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 mcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown. Immunologic Effects Neutralizing antibody responses to RSV were decreased in aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP-treated infants compared to placebo-treated infants. 3 One study also showed that RSV-specific IgE antibody in bronchial secretions was decreased in patients treated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. In rats, ribavirin administration resulted in lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Humoral immunity was reduced in guinea pigs and ferrets. Cellular immunity was also mildly depressed in animal studies. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Assay for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u03bcM. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u03bc M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u03bc M. The bioavailability of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations manyfold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus, and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined. Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV. Treatment early in the course of severe lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection should be treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. The vast majority of infants and children with RSV infection have disease that is mild, self-limited, and does not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. Many children with mild lower respiratory tract involvement will require shorter hospitalization than would be required for a full course of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol (3 to 7 days) and should not be treated with the drug. Thus the decision to treat with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be based on the severity of the RSV infection. The presence of an underlying condition such as prematurity, immunosuppression or cardiopulmonary disease may increase the severity of clinical manifestations and complications of RSV infection. Use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in patients requiring mechanical ventilator assistance should be undertaken only by physicians and support staff familiar with this mode of administration and the specific ventilator being used (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Diagnosis RSV infection should be documented by a rapid diagnostic method such as demonstration of viral antigen in respiratory tract secretions by immunofluorescence 3,4 or ELISA 5 before or during the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection. Non-culture antigen detection techniques may have false positive or false negative results. Assessment of the clinical situation, the time of year and other parameters may warrant reevaluation of the laboratory diagnosis. Description of Studies Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants In two placebo-controlled trials in infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment had a therapeutic effect, as judged by the reduction in severity of clinical manifestations of disease by treatment day 3. 3,4 Treatment was most effective when instituted within the first 3 days of clinical illness. Virus titers in respiratory secretions were also significantly reduced with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in one of these original studies. 4 Additional controlled studies conducted since these initial trials of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in the treatment of RSV infection have supported these data. Mechanically Ventilated Infants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP at the recommended dose was conducted in 28 infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by documented RSV infection. 6 Mean age was 1.4 months (SD, 1.7 months). Seven patients had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection and 21 were previously normal. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment significantly decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation required (4.9 vs. 9.9 days, p=0.01) and duration of required supplemental oxygen (8.7 vs. 13.5 days, p=0.01). Intensive patient management and monitoring techniques were employed in this study. These included endotracheal tube suctioning every 1 to 2 hours; recording of proximal airway pressure, ventilatory rate, and F l O 2 every hour; and arterial blood gas monitoring every 2 to 6 hours. To reduce the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation and ventilator malfunction, heated wire tubing, two bacterial filters connected in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator (with filter changes every 4 hours), and water column pressure release valves to monitor internal ventilator pressures were used in connecting ventilator circuits to the SPAG \u00ae -2. Employing these techniques, no technical difficulties with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration were encountered during the study. Adverse events consisted of bacterial pneumonia in one case, staphylococcus bacteremia in one case and two cases of post-extubation stridor. None were felt to be related to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Therefore, although clinical studies have not been performed, it should be assumed that Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. Studies in which the drug has been administered systemically demonstrate that ribavirin is concentrated in the red blood cells and persists for the life of the erythrocyte."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS SUDDEN DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATION OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP USE IN INFANTS. Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and reinstituted only with extreme caution, continuous monitoring, and consideration of concomitant administration of bronchodilators. Use with Mechanical Ventilators USE OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP IN PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY BY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH THIS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE SPECIFIC VENTILATOR BEING USED. Strict attention must be paid to procedures that have been shown to minimize the accumulation of drug precipitate, which can result in mechanical ventilator dysfunction and associated increased pulmonary pressures. These procedures include the use of bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit with frequent changes (every 4 hours), water column pressure release valves to indicate elevated ventilator pressures, frequent monitoring of these devices and verification that ribavirin crystals have not accumulated within the ventilator circuitry, and frequent suctioning and monitoring of the patient (see Description of Studies ). Those administering aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in conjunction with mechanical ventilator use should be thoroughly familiar with detailed descriptions of these procedures as outlined in the SPAG-2 Instructions for Use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). Drug Interactions Clinical studies of interactions of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with other drugs commonly used to treat infants with RSV infections, such as digoxin, bronchodilators, other antiviral agents, antibiotics or anti-metabolites, have not been conducted. Interference by Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with laboratory tests has not been evaluated. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin increased the incidence of cell transformations and mutations in mouse Balb/c 3T3 (fibroblasts) and L5178Y (lymphoma) cells at concentrations of 0.015 and 0.03-5.0 mg/mL, respectively (without metabolic activation). Modest increases in mutation rates (3-4x) were observed at concentrations between 3.75-10.0 mg/mL in L5178Y cells in vitro with the addition of a metabolic activation fraction. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ribavirin was clastogenic at intravenous doses of 20-200 mg/kg, (estimated human equivalent of 1.67-16.7 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult). Ribavirin was not mutagenic in a dominant lethal assay in rats at intraperitoneal doses between 50-200 mg/kg when administered for 5 days (estimated human equivalent of 7.14-28.6 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). In vivo carcinogenicity studies with ribavirin are incomplete. However, results of a chronic feeding study with ribavirin in rats, at doses of 16-100 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.3-14.3 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult), suggest that ribavirin may induce benign mammary, pancreatic, pituitary and adrenal tumors. Preliminary results of two oral gavage oncogenicity studies in the mouse and rat (18-24 months; doses of 20-75 and 10-40 mg/kg/day, respectively [estimated human equivalent of 1.67-6.25 and 1.43-5.71 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult]) are inconclusive as to the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin (see Pharmacokinetics ). However, these studies have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages in mice) and retinal degeneration (in rats). Impairment of Fertility The fertility of ribavirin-treated animals (male or female) has not been fully investigated. However, in the mouse, administration of ribavirin at doses between 35-150 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.92-12.5 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult) resulted in significant seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm concentrations, and increased numbers of sperm with abnormal morphology. Partial recovery of sperm production was apparent 3-6 months following dose cessation. In several additional toxicology studies, ribavirin has been shown to cause testicular lesions (tubular atrophy) in adult rats at oral dose levels as low as 16 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.29 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). Lower doses were not tested. The reproductive capacity of treated male animals has not been studied. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Teratogenic effects were evident after single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater in the hamster, and after daily oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the rabbit and rat, respectively (estimated human equivalent doses of 0.12 and 0.14 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult). Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced. Ribavirin caused embryolethality in the rabbit at daily oral dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were evident in the rabbit and rat administered daily oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively with estimated human equivalent doses of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment (see Pharmacokinetics ). These doses are considered to define the No Observable Teratogenic Effects Level (NOTEL) for ribavirin in the rabbit and rat. Following oral administration of ribavirin in the pregnant rat (1.0 mg/kg) and rabbit (0.3 mg/kg), mean plasma levels of drug ranged from 0.10-0.20 \u03bc M [0.024-0.049 \u03bc /mL] at 1 hour after dosing, to undetectable levels at 24 hours. At 1 hour following the administration of 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg in the rat and rabbit (NOTEL), respectively, mean plasma levels of drug in both species were near or below the limit of detection (0.05 \u03bc M; see Pharmacokinetics ). Although clinical studies have not been performed, Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. As noted previously, ribavirin is concentrated in red blood cells and persists for the life of the cell. Thus the terminal half-life for the systemic elimination of ribavirin is essentially that of the half-life of circulating erythrocytes. The minimum interval following exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP before pregnancy may be safely initiated is unknown (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and Information for Health Care Personnel ). Lactation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP has been shown to be toxic to lactating animals and their offspring. It is not known if Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is excreted in human milk. Information for Health Care Personnel Health care workers directly providing care to patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be aware that ribavirin has been shown to be teratogenic in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Although no reports of teratogenesis in offspring of mothers who were exposed to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP during pregnancy have been confirmed, no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Studies of environmental exposure in treatment settings have shown that the drug can disperse into the immediate bedside area during routine patient care activities with highest ambient levels closest to the patient and extremely low levels outside of the immediate bedside area. Adverse reactions resulting from actual occupational exposure in adults are described below (see Adverse Events in Health Care Workers ). Some studies have documented ambient drug concentrations at the bedside that could potentially lead to systemic exposures above those considered safe for exposure during pregnancy (1/1000 of the NOTEL dose in the most sensitive animal species). 7, 8, 9 A 1992 study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrated measurable urine levels of ribavirin in health care workers exposed to aerosol in the course of direct patient care. 7 Levels were lowest in workers caring for infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with mechanical ventilation and highest in those caring for patients being administered the drug via an oxygen tent or hood. This study employed a more sensitive assay to evaluate ribavirin levels in urine than was available for several previous studies of environmental exposure that failed to detect measurable ribavirin levels in exposed workers. Creatinine adjusted urine levels in the NIOSH study ranged from less than 0.001 to 0.140 \u03bc M of ribavirin per gram of creatinine in exposed workers. However, the relationship between urinary ribavirin levels in exposed workers, plasma levels in animal studies, and the specific risk of teratogenesis in exposed pregnant women is unknown. It is good practice to avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to chemicals wherever possible. Hospitals are encouraged to conduct training programs to minimize potential occupational exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Health care workers who are pregnant should consider avoiding direct care of patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. If close patient contact cannot be avoided, precautions to limit exposure should be taken. These include administration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in negative pressure rooms; adequate room ventilation (at least six air exchanges per hour); the use of scavenging devices; turning off the SPAG-2 device for 5 to 10 minutes prior to prolonged patient contact; and wearing appropriately fitted respirator masks. Surgical masks do not provide adequate filtration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP particles. Further information is available from NIOSH's Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch and additional recommendations have been published in an Aerosol Consensus Statement by the American Respiratory Care Foundation and the American Association for Respiratory Care. 10"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The description of adverse reactions is based on events from clinical studies (approximately 200 patients) conducted prior to 1986, and the controlled trial of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP conducted in 1989-1990. Additional data from spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse events in individual patients have been available since 1986. Deaths Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections). Several cases have been characterized as \"possibly related\" to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP by the treating physician; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug. Several other cases have been attributed to mechanical ventilator malfunction in which Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation within the ventilator apparatus led to excessively high pulmonary pressures and diminished oxygenation. In these cases the monitoring procedures described in the current package insert were not employed (see Description of Studies , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Pulmonary function significantly deteriorated during aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment in six of six adults with chronic obstructive lung disease and in four of six asthmatic adults. Dyspnea and chest soreness were also reported in the latter group. Minor abnormalities in pulmonary function were also seen in healthy adult volunteers. In the original study population of approximately 200 infants who received aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with lifethreatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. The role of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in these events is indeterminate. Since the drug's approval in 1986, additional reports of similar serious, though non-fatal, events have been filed infrequently. Events associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have included the following: Pulmonary Worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, hypoventilation, cyanosis, dyspnea, bacterial pneumonia, pneumothorax, apnea, atelectasis and ventilator dependence. Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia and digitalis toxicity. Bigeminy, bradycardia and tachycardia have been described in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation experienced serious difficulties, due to inadequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (\"rain out\") has also been noted. Measures to avoid these complications should be followed carefully (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hematologic Although anemia was not reported with use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in controlled clinical trials, most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 to 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Anemia has been shown to occur frequently with experimental oral and intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in humans. Also, cases of anemia (type unspecified), reticulocytosis and hemolytic anemia associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have been reported through post-marketing reporting systems. All have been reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Other Rash and conjunctivitis have been associated with the use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. These usually resolve within hours of discontinuing therapy. Seizures and asthenia associated with experimental intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP therapy have also been reported. Adverse Events in Health Care Workers Studies of environmental exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in health care workers administering care to patients receiving the drug have not detected adverse signs or symptoms related to exposure. However, 152 health care workers have reported experiencing adverse events through post-marketing surveillance. Nearly all were in individuals providing direct care to infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Of 358 events from these 152 individual health care worker reports, the most common signs and symptoms were headache (51% of reports), conjunctivitis (32%), and rhinitis, nausea, rash, dizziness, pharyngitis, or lacrimation (10-20% each). Several cases of bronchospasm and/or chest pain were also reported, usually in individuals with known underlying reactive airway disease. Several case reports of damage to contact lenses after prolonged close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have also been reported. Most signs and symptoms reported as having occurred in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of discontinuing close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (also see Information for Health Care Personnel ). The symptoms of RSV in adults can include headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat and/or cough, fever, hoarseness, nasal congestion and wheezing, although RSV infections in adults are typically mild and transient. Such infections represent a potential hazard to uninfected hospital patients. It is unknown whether certain symptoms cited in reports from health care workers were due to exposure to the drug or infection with RSV. Hospitals should implement appropriate infection control procedures.

AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH ANY OTHER AEROSOL GENERATING DEVICE. The recommended treatment regimen is 20 mg/mL Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP as the starting solution in the drug reservoir of the SPAG-2 unit, with continuous aerosol administration for 12-18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days. Using the recommended drug concentration of 20 mg/mL the average aerosol concentration for a 12 hour delivery period would be 190 mcg/L of air. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should not be administered in a mixture for combined aerosolization or simultaneously with other aerosolized medications. Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be delivered to an infant oxygen hood from the SPAG \u00ae -2 aerosol generator. Administration by face mask or oxygen tent may be necessary if a hood cannot be employed (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). However, the volume and condensation area are larger in a tent and this may alter delivery dynamics of the drug. Mechanically Ventilated Infants The recommended dose and administration schedule for infants who require mechanical ventilation is the same as for those who do not. Either a pressure or volume cycle ventilator may be used in conjunction with the SPAG-2. In either case, patients should have their endotracheal tubes suctioned every 1-2 hours, and their pulmonary pressures monitored frequently (every 2-4 hours). For both pressure and volume ventilators, heated wire connective tubing and bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the system (which must be changed frequently, i.e., every 4 hours) must be used to minimize the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation in the system and the subsequent risk of ventilator dysfunction. Water column pressure release valves should be used in the ventilator circuit for pressure cycled ventilators, and may be utilized with volume cycled ventilators (see SPAG-2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS). Method of Preparation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is supplied as 6 grams of lyophilized powder per 100 mL vial for aerosol administration only. By sterile technique, reconstitute drug with a minimum of 75 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP or Inhalation in the original 100 mL glass vial. Shake well . Transfer to the clean, sterilized 500 mL SPAG-2 reservoir and further dilute to a final volume of 300 mL with Sterile Water for Injection, USP or Inhalation. The final concentration should be 20 mg/mL. Important: This water should NOT have had any antimicrobial agent or other substance added. The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Solutions that have been placed in the SPAG-2 unit should be discarded at least every 24 hours and when the liquid level is low before adding newly reconstituted solution."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In cell cultures the inhibitory activity of ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is selective. The mechanism of action is unknown. Reversal of the in vitro antiviral activity by guanosine or xanthosine suggests ribavirin may act as an analogue of these cellular metabolites. Microbiology Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV in vitro 1 and in experimentally infected cotton rats. 2 Several clinical isolates of RSV were evaluated for ribavirin susceptibility by plaque reduction in tissue culture. Plaques were reduced 85-98% by 16 mcg/mL; however, results may vary with the test system. The development of resistance has not been evaluated in vitro or in clinical trials. In addition to the above, ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against influenza A and B viruses and herpes simplex virus, but the clinical significance of these data is unknown. Immunologic Effects Neutralizing antibody responses to RSV were decreased in aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP-treated infants compared to placebo-treated infants. 3 One study also showed that RSV-specific IgE antibody in bronchial secretions was decreased in patients treated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. In rats, ribavirin administration resulted in lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Humoral immunity was reduced in guinea pigs and ferrets. Cellular immunity was also mildly depressed in animal studies. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Assay for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in human materials is by a radioimmunoassay which detects ribavirin and at least one metabolite. Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, when administered by aerosol, is absorbed systemically. Four pediatric patients inhaling Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol administered by face mask for 2.5 hours each day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u00b5 M, with a mean concentration of 0.76 \u00b5 M. The plasma half-life was reported to be 9.5 hours. Three pediatric patients inhaling aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administered by face mask or mist tent for 20 hours each day for 5 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 14.3 \u00b5 M, with a mean concentration of 6.8 \u00b5 M. The bioavailability of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is unknown and may depend on the mode of aerosol delivery. After aerosol treatment, peak plasma concentrations of ribavirin are 85% to 98% less than the concentration that reduced RSV plaque formation in tissue culture. After aerosol treatment, respiratory tract secretions are likely to contain ribavirin in concentrations manyfold higher than those required to reduce plaque formation. However, RSV is an intracellular virus, and it is unknown whether plasma concentrations or respiratory secretion concentrations of the drug better reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory tract. In man, rats, and rhesus monkeys, accumulation of ribavirin and/or metabolites in the red blood cells has been noted, plateauing in red cells in man in about 4 days and gradually declining with an apparent half-life of 40 days (the half-life of erythrocytes). The extent of accumulation of ribavirin following inhalation therapy is not well defined. Animal Toxicology Ribavirin, when administered orally or as an aerosol, produced cardiac lesions in mice, rats, and monkeys, when given at doses of 30, 36 and 120 mg/kg or greater for 4 weeks or more (estimated human equivalent doses of 4.8, 12.3 and 111.4 mg/kg for a 5 kg child, or 2.5, 5.1 and 40 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult, based on body surface area adjustment). Aerosolized ribavirin administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen in the lungs following exposure at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV. Treatment early in the course of severe lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection should be treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. The vast majority of infants and children with RSV infection have disease that is mild, self-limited, and does not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. Many children with mild lower respiratory tract involvement will require shorter hospitalization than would be required for a full course of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP aerosol (3 to 7 days) and should not be treated with the drug. Thus the decision to treat with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be based on the severity of the RSV infection. The presence of an underlying condition such as prematurity, immunosuppression or cardiopulmonary disease may increase the severity of clinical manifestations and complications of RSV infection. Use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in patients requiring mechanical ventilator assistance should be undertaken only by physicians and support staff familiar with this mode of administration and the specific ventilator being used (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Diagnosis RSV infection should be documented by a rapid diagnostic method such as demonstration of viral antigen in respiratory tract secretions by immunofluorescence 3,4 or ELISA 5 before or during the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection. Non-culture antigen detection techniques may have false positive or false negative results. Assessment of the clinical situation, the time of year and other parameters may warrant reevaluation of the laboratory diagnosis. Description of Studies Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants: In two placebo-controlled trials in infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment had a therapeutic effect, as judged by the reduction in severity of clinical manifestations of disease by treatment day 3. 3,4 Treatment was most effective when instituted within the first 3 days of clinical illness. Virus titers in respiratory secretions were also significantly reduced with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in one of these original studies. 4 Additional controlled studies conducted since these initial trials of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in the treatment of RSV infection have supported these data. Mechanically Ventilated Infants: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP at the recommended dose was conducted in 28 infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by documented RSV infection. 6 Mean age was 1.4 months (SD, 1.7 months). Seven patients had underlying diseases predisposing them to severe infection and 21 were previously normal. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment significantly decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation required (4.9 vs. 9.9 days, p=0.01) and duration of required supplemental oxygen (8.7 vs. 13.5 days, p=0.01). Intensive patient management and monitoring techniques were employed in this study. These included endotracheal tube suctioning every 1 to 2 hours; recording of proximal airway pressure, ventilatory rate, and F l O 2 every hour; and arterial blood gas monitoring every 2 to 6 hours. To reduce the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation and ventilator malfunction, heated wire tubing, two bacterial filters connected in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator (with filter changes every 4 hours), and water column pressure release valves to monitor internal ventilator pressures were used in connecting ventilator circuits to the SPAG \u00ae -2. Employing these techniques, no technical difficulties with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration were encountered during the study. Adverse events consisted of bacterial pneumonia in one case, staphylococcus bacteremia in one case and two cases of post-extubation stridor. None were felt to be related to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP administration."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Therefore, although clinical studies have not been performed, it should be assumed that Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. Studies in which the drug has been administered systemically demonstrate that ribavirin is concentrated in the red blood cells and persists for the life of the erythrocyte."

      "WARNINGS SUDDEN DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATION OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP USE IN INFANTS. Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and reinstituted only with extreme caution, continuous monitoring, and consideration of concomitant administration of bronchodilators. Use with Mechanical Ventilators USE OF AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP IN PATIENTS REQUIRING MECHANICAL VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY BY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH THIS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE SPECIFIC VENTILATOR BEING USED. Strict attention must be paid to procedures that have been shown to minimize the accumulation of drug precipitate, which can result in mechanical ventilator dysfunction and associated increased pulmonary pressures. These procedures include the use of bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit with frequent changes (every 4 hours), water column pressure release valves to indicate elevated ventilator pressures, frequent monitoring of these devices and verification that ribavirin crystals have not accumulated within the ventilator circuitry, and frequent suctioning and monitoring of the patient (see Description of Studies). Those administering aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in conjunction with mechanical ventilator use should be thoroughly familiar with detailed descriptions of these procedures as outlined in the SPAG-2 Instructions for Use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). Drug Interactions Clinical studies of interactions of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with other drugs commonly used to treat infants with RSV infections, such as digoxin, bronchodilators, other antiviral agents, antibiotics or anti-metabolites, have not been conducted. Interference by Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with laboratory tests has not been evaluated. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin increased the incidence of cell transformations and mutations in mouse Balb/c 3T3 (fibroblasts) and L5178Y (lymphoma) cells at concentrations of 0.015 and 0.03-5.0 mg/mL, respectively (without metabolic activation). Modest increases in mutation rates (3-4x) were observed at concentrations between 3.75-10.0 mg/mL in L5178Y cells in vitro with the addition of a metabolic activation fraction. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ribavirin was clastogenic at intravenous doses of 20-200 mg/kg, (estimated human equivalent of 1.67-16.7 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult). Ribavirin was not mutagenic in a dominant lethal assay in rats at intraperitoneal doses between 50-200 mg/kg when administered for 5 days (estimated human equivalent of 7.14-28.6 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). In vivo carcinogenicity studies with ribavirin are incomplete. However, results of a chronic feeding study with ribavirin in rats, at doses of 16-100 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.3-14.3 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult), suggest that ribavirin may induce benign mammary, pancreatic, pituitary and adrenal tumors. Preliminary results of two oral gavage oncogenicity studies in the mouse and rat (18-24 months; doses of 20-75 and 10-40 mg/kg/day, respectively [estimated human equivalent of 1.67-6.25 and 1.43-5.71 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult]) are inconclusive as to the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin (see Pharmacokinetics ). However, these studies have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages in mice) and retinal degeneration (in rats). Impairment of Fertility The fertility of ribavirin-treated animals (male or female) has not been fully investigated. However, in the mouse, administration of ribavirin at doses between 35-150 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.92-12.5 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult) resulted in significant seminiferous tubule atrophy, decreased sperm concentrations, and increased numbers of sperm with abnormal morphology. Partial recovery of sperm production was apparent 3-6 months following dose cessation. In several additional toxicology studies, ribavirin has been shown to cause testicular lesions (tubular atrophy) in adult rats at oral dose levels as low as 16 mg/kg/day (estimated human equivalent of 2.29 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area adjustment; see Pharmacokinetics ). Lower doses were not tested. The reproductive capacity of treated male animals has not been studied. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Teratogenic effects were evident after single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater in the hamster, and after daily oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the rabbit and rat, respectively (estimated human equivalent doses of 0.12 and 0.14 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment for the adult). Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced. Ribavirin caused embryolethality in the rabbit at daily oral dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were evident in the rabbit and rat administered daily oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively with estimated human equivalent doses of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, based on body surface area adjustment (see Pharmacokinetics ). These doses are considered to define the No Observable Teratogenic Effects Level (NOTEL) for ribavirin in the rabbit and rat. Following oral administration of ribavirin in the pregnant rat (1.0 mg/kg) and rabbit (0.3 mg/kg), mean plasma levels of drug ranged from 0.10-0.20 \u00b5 M [0.024-0.049 \u00b5 /mL] at 1 hour after dosing, to undetectable levels at 24 hours. At 1 hour following the administration of 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg in the rat and rabbit (NOTEL), respectively, mean plasma levels of drug in both species were near or below the limit of detection (0.05 \u00b5 M; see Pharmacokinetics ). Although clinical studies have not been performed, Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP may cause fetal harm in humans. As noted previously, ribavirin is concentrated in red blood cells and persists for the life of the cell. Thus the terminal half-life for the systemic elimination of ribavirin is essentially that of the half-life of circulating erythrocytes. The minimum interval following exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP before pregnancy may be safely initiated is unknown (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and Information for Health Care Personnel ). Lactation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP has been shown to be toxic to lactating animals and their offspring. It is not known if Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is excreted in human milk. Information for Health Care Personnel Health care workers directly providing care to patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be aware that ribavirin has been shown to be teratogenic in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted (rodents and rabbits). Although no reports of teratogenesis in offspring of mothers who were exposed to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP during pregnancy have been confirmed, no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Studies of environmental exposure in treatment settings have shown that the drug can disperse into the immediate bedside area during routine patient care activities with highest ambient levels closest to the patient and extremely low levels outside of the immediate bedside area. Adverse reactions resulting from actual occupational exposure in adults are described below (see Adverse Events in Health Care Workers ). Some studies have documented ambient drug concentrations at the bedside that could potentially lead to systemic exposures above those considered safe for exposure during pregnancy (1/1000 of the NOTEL dose in the most sensitive animal species). 7, 8, 9 A 1992 study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrated measurable urine levels of ribavirin in health care workers exposed to aerosol in the course of direct patient care. 7 Levels were lowest in workers caring for infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP with mechanical ventilation and highest in those caring for patients being administered the drug via an oxygen tent or hood. This study employed a more sensitive assay to evaluate ribavirin levels in urine than was available for several previous studies of environmental exposure that failed to detect measurable ribavirin levels in exposed workers. Creatinine adjusted urine levels in the NIOSH study ranged from less than 0.001 to 0.140 \u00b5 M of ribavirin per gram of creatinine in exposed workers. However, the relationship between urinary ribavirin levels in exposed workers, plasma levels in animal studies, and the specific risk of teratogenesis in exposed pregnant women is unknown. It is good practice to avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to chemicals wherever possible. Hospitals are encouraged to conduct training programs to minimize potential occupational exposure to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Health care workers who are pregnant should consider avoiding direct care of patients receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. If close patient contact cannot be avoided, precautions to limit exposure should be taken. These include administration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in negative pressure rooms; adequate room ventilation (at least six air exchanges per hour); the use of scavenging devices; turning off the SPAG-2 device for 5 to 10 minutes prior to prolonged patient contact; and wearing appropriately fitted respirator masks. Surgical masks do not provide adequate filtration of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP particles. Further information is available from NIOSH\u2019s Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch and additional recommendations have been published in an Aerosol Consensus Statement by the American Respiratory Care Foundation and the American Association for Respiratory Care. 10"

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The description of adverse reactions is based on events from clinical studies (approximately 200 patients) conducted prior to 1986, and the controlled trial of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP conducted in 1989-1990. Additional data from spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse events in individual patients have been available since 1986. Deaths Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections). Several cases have been characterized as \u201cpossibly related\u201d to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP by the treating physician; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug. Several other cases have been attributed to mechanical ventilator malfunction in which Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation within the ventilator apparatus led to excessively high pulmonary pressures and diminished oxygenation. In these cases the monitoring procedures described in the current package insert were not employed (see Description of Studies , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Pulmonary function significantly deteriorated during aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP treatment in six of six adults with chronic obstructive lung disease and in four of six asthmatic adults. Dyspnea and chest soreness were also reported in the latter group. Minor abnormalities in pulmonary function were also seen in healthy adult volunteers. In the original study population of approximately 200 infants who received aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with life-threatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. The role of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in these events is indeterminate. Since the drug\u2019s approval in 1986, additional reports of similar serious, though non-fatal, events have been filed infrequently. Events associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have included the following: Pulmonary: Worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, hypoventilation, cyanosis, dyspnea, bacterial pneumonia, pneumothorax, apnea, atelectasis and ventilator dependence. Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia and digitalis toxicity. Bigeminy, bradycardia and tachycardia have been described in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation experienced serious difficulties, due to inadequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (\u201crain out\u201d) has also been noted. Measures to avoid these complications should be followed carefully (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hematologic Although anemia was not reported with use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in controlled clinical trials, most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 to 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Anemia has been shown to occur frequently with experimental oral and intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in humans. Also, cases of anemia (type unspecified), reticulocytosis and hemolytic anemia associated with aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP use have been reported through post-marketing reporting systems. All have been reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Other Rash and conjunctivitis have been associated with the use of aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. These usually resolve within hours of discontinuing therapy. Seizures and asthenia associated with experimental intravenous Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP therapy have also been reported. Adverse Events in Health Care Workers Studies of environmental exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP in health care workers administering care to patients receiving the drug have not detected adverse signs or symptoms related to exposure. However, 152 health care workers have reported experiencing adverse events through post-marketing surveillance. Nearly all were in individuals providing direct care to infants receiving aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. Of 358 events from these 152 individual health care worker reports, the most common signs and symptoms were headache (51% of reports), conjunctivitis (32%), and rhinitis, nausea, rash, dizziness, pharyngitis, or lacrimation (10-20% each). Several cases of bronchospasm and/or chest pain were also reported, usually in individuals with known underlying reactive airway disease. Several case reports of damage to contact lenses after prolonged close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP have also been reported. Most signs and symptoms reported as having occurred in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of discontinuing close exposure to aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP (also see Information for Health Care Personnel ). The symptoms of RSV in adults can include headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat and/or cough, fever, hoarseness, nasal congestion and wheezing, although RSV infections in adults are typically mild and transient. Such infections represent a potential hazard to uninfected hospital patients. It is unknown whether certain symptoms cited in reports from health care workers were due to exposure to the drug or infection with RSV. Hospitals should implement appropriate infection control procedures.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BEFORE USE, READ THOROUGHLY THE BAUSCH HEALTH SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR SPAG-2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR SMALL PARTICLE AEROSOL GENERATOR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS. AEROSOLIZED RIBAVIRIN FOR INHALATION SOLUTION, USP HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH ANY OTHER AEROSOL GENERATING DEVICE. The recommended treatment regimen is 20 mg/mL Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP as the starting solution in the drug reservoir of the SPAG-2 unit, with continuous aerosol administration for 12-18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days. Using the recommended drug concentration of 20 mg/mL the average aerosol concentration for a 12 hour delivery period would be 190 mcg/L of air. Aerosolized Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should not be administered in a mixture for combined aerosolization or simultaneously with other aerosolized medications. Non-Mechanically Ventilated Infants Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP should be delivered to an infant oxygen hood from the SPAG \u00ae -2 aerosol generator. Administration by face mask or oxygen tent may be necessary if a hood cannot be employed (see SPAG-2 Instructions for Use). However, the volume and condensation area are larger in a tent and this may alter delivery dynamics of the drug. Mechanically Ventilated Infants The recommended dose and administration schedule for infants who require mechanical ventilation is the same as for those who do not. Either a pressure or volume cycle ventilator may be used in conjunction with the SPAG-2. In either case, patients should have their endotracheal tubes suctioned every 1-2 hours, and their pulmonary pressures monitored frequently (every 2-4 hours). For both pressure and volume ventilators, heated wire connective tubing and bacteria filters in series in the expiratory limb of the system (which must be changed frequently, i.e., every 4 hours) must be used to minimize the risk of Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP precipitation in the system and the subsequent risk of ventilator dysfunction. Water column pressure release valves should be used in the ventilator circuit for pressure cycled ventilators, and may be utilized with volume cycled ventilators (see SPAG-2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS). Method of Preparation Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP is supplied as 6 grams of lyophilized powder per 100 mL vial for aerosol administration only. By sterile technique, reconstitute drug with a minimum of 75 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP or Inhalation in the original 100 mL glass vial. Shake well . Transfer to the clean, sterilized 500 mL SPAG-2 reservoir and further dilute to a final volume of 300 mL with Sterile Water for Injection, USP or Inhalation. The final concentration should be 20 mg/mL. Important: This water should NOT have had any antimicrobial agent or other substance added. The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Solutions that have been placed in the SPAG-2 unit should be discarded at least every 24 hours and when the liquid level is low before adding newly reconstituted solution."

      "WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS DISORDERS AND RIBAVIRIN-ASSOCIATED EFFECTS Ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection and should not be used alone for this indication. The primary clinical toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia. The anemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in worsening of cardiac disease and lead to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not be treated with ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. In addition, ribavirin has a multiple dose half-life of 12 days, and it may persist in non-plasma compartments for as long as 6 months. Therefore, ribavirin, including ribavirin tablets, are contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months after completion of therapy in both female patients and in female partners of male patients who are taking ribavirin therapy. At least two reliable forms of effective contraception must be utilized during treatment and during the 6-month post treatment follow-up period [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin tablets in combination with PEGASYS \u00ae (peginterferon alfa-2a) are indicated for the treatment of patients 5 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection who have compensated liver disease and have not been previously treated with interferon alpha. The following points should be considered when initiating ribavirin tablets combination therapy with PEGASYS \u00ae : This indication is based on clinical trials of combination therapy in patients with CHC and compensated liver disease, some of whom had histological evidence of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A), and in adult patients with clinically stable HIV disease and CD4 count greater than 100 cells/mm 3 . This indication is based on achieving undetectable HCV RNA after treatment for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype, and maintaining a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 24 weeks after the last dose. Safety and efficacy data are not available for treatment longer than 48 weeks. The safety and efficacy of ribavirin tablets and PEGASYS \u00ae therapy have not been established in liver or other organ transplant recipients, patients with decompensated liver disease, or previous non-responders to interferon therapy. The safety and efficacy of ribavirin tablets therapy for the treatment of adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza or influenza infections have not been established. Ribavirin tablets should not be used for these indications. Ribavirin for inhalation has a separate package insert, which should be consulted if ribavirin inhalation therapy is being considered. Ribavirin tablets are a nucleoside analogue indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection in combination with PEGASYS \u00ae in patients 5 years of age and older with compensated liver disease not previously treated with interferon alpha, and in adult CHC patients coinfected with HIV (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ribavirin tablets should be taken with food. Ribavirin tablets should be given in combination with PEGASYS \u00ae ; it is important to note that ribavirin tablets should never be given as monotherapy. See PEGASYS \u00ae Package Insert for all instructions regarding PEGASYS \u00ae dosing and administration. CHC: Ribavirin tablets are administered according to body weight and genotype (2.1) CHC with HIV coinfection: 800 mg by mouth daily for a total of 48 weeks, regardless of genotype (2.2) Dose reduction or discontinuation is recommended in patients experiencing certain adverse reactions or renal impairment (2.3 , 2.4) 2.1 Chronic Hepatitis C Monoinfection Adult Patients The recommended dose of ribavirin tablets is provided in Table 1 . The recommended duration of treatment for patients previously untreated with ribavirin and interferon is 24 to 48 weeks. The daily dose of ribavirin tablets is 800 mg to 1200 mg administered orally in two divided doses. The dose should be individualized to the patient depending on baseline disease characteristics (e.g., genotype), response to therapy, and tolerability of the regimen (see Table 1 ). Table 1 PEGASYS \u00ae and Ribavirin Tablets Dosing Recommendations Genotypes 2 and 3 showed no increased response to treatment beyond 24 weeks (see Table 10 ). Data on genotypes 5 and 6 are insufficient for dosing recommendations. * See PEGASYS \u00ae Package Insert for further details on PEGASYS \u00ae dosing and administration, including dose modification in patients with renal impairment. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype PEGASYS \u00ae Dose* (once weekly) Ribavirin Tablets Dose (daily) Duration Genotypes 1, 4 180 mcg <75 kg = 1000 mg \u226575 kg = 1200 mg 48 weeks 48 weeks Genotypes 2, 3 180 mcg 800 mg 24 weeks Pediatric Patients PEGASYS \u00ae is administered as 180 mcg/1.73m 2 x BSA once weekly subcutaneously, to a maximum dose of 180 mcg, and should be given in combination with ribavirin. The recommended treatment duration for patients with genotype 2 or 3 is 24 weeks and for other genotypes is 48 weeks. Ribavirin tablets should be given in combination with PEGASYS \u00ae . Ribavirin tablets are available only as a 200 mg tablet and therefore the healthcare provider should determine if this sized tablet can be swallowed by the pediatric patient. The recommended doses for ribavirin tablets are provided in Table 2 . Patients who initiate treatment prior to their 18 th birthday should maintain pediatric dosing through the completion of therapy. Table 2 Ribavirin Tablets Dosing Recommendations for Pediatric Patients *approximately 15 mg/kg/day Body Weight in kilograms (kg) Ribavirin Tablets Daily Dose* Ribavirin Tablets Number of Tablets 23 to 33 400 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablet A.M. 1 x 200 mg tablet P.M. 34 to 46 600 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablet A.M. 2 x 200 mg tablets P.M. 47 to 59 800 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M. 2 x 200 mg tablets P.M. 60 to 74 1000 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M. 3 x 200 mg tablets P.M. \u226575 1200 mg/day 3 x 200 mg tablets A.M. 3 x 200 mg tablets P.M. 2.2 Chronic Hepatitis C with HIV Coinfection Adult Patients The recommended dose for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients coinfected with HIV is PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg subcutaneous once weekly and ribavirin tablets 800 mg by mouth daily for a total duration of 48 weeks, regardless of HCV genotype. 2.3 Dose Modifications Adult and Pediatric Patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during combination ribavirin tablets/PEGASYS \u00ae therapy, the dose should be modified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate or decrease in severity. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment, ribavirin tablets/PEGASYS \u00ae therapy should be discontinued. Table 3 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s hemoglobin concentration and cardiac status. Ribavirin tablets should be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Patients should be assessed before commencement of therapy and should be appropriately monitored during therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be stopped [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Table 3 Ribavirin Tablets Dose Modification Guidelines in Adults and Pediatrics Body weight in kilograms (kg) Laboratory Values Hemoglobin <10 g/dL in patients with no cardiac disease, or Decrease in hemoglobin of \u22652 g/dL during any 4 week period in patients with history of stable cardiac disease Hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL in patients with no cardiac disease, or Hemoglobin <12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at reduced dose in patients with history of stable cardiac disease Adult Patients older than 18 years of age Any weight 1 x 200 mg tablet A.M. 2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.

The guidelines for ribavirin tablets dose modifications outlined in this table also apply to laboratory abnormalities or adverse reactions other than decreases in hemoglobin values. Adult Patients Once ribavirin tablets have been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical adverse reaction, an attempt may be made to restart ribavirin tablets at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily. However, it is not recommended that ribavirin tablets be increased to the original assigned dose (1000 mg to 1200 mg). Pediatric Patients Upon resolution of a laboratory abnormality or clinical adverse reaction, an increase in ribavirin tablets dose to the original dose may be attempted depending upon the physician\u2019s judgment. If ribavirin tablets have been withheld due to a laboratory abnormality or clinical adverse reaction, an attempt may be made to restart ribavirin tablets at one-half the full dose. 2.4 Renal Impairment The total daily dose of ribavirin tablets should be reduced for patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min; and the weekly dose of PEGASYS \u00ae should be reduced for creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min as follows in Table 4 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Pharmacokinetics (12.3) , and PEGASYS \u00ae Package Insert] . Table 4 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance PEGASYS \u00ae Dose (once weekly) Ribavirin Tablets Dose (daily) 30 to 50 mL/min 180 mcg Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day Less than 30 mL/min 135 mcg 200 mg daily Hemodialysis 135 mcg 200 mg daily The dose of ribavirin tablets should not be further modified in patients with renal impairment. If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop, ribavirin tablets should be discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate or decrease in severity. If intolerance persists after restarting ribavirin tablets, ribavirin tablets/PEGASYS \u00ae therapy should be discontinued. No data are available for pediatric subjects with renal impairment. 2.5 Discontinuation of Dosing Discontinuation of PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin tablets therapy should be considered if the patient has failed to demonstrate at least a 2 log 10 reduction from baseline in HCV RNA by 12 weeks of therapy, or undetectable HCV RNA levels after 24 weeks of therapy. PEGASYS \u00ae /Ribavirin tablets therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop hepatic decompensation during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Significant adverse reactions associated with ribavirin/PEGASYS \u00ae combination therapy include severe depression and suicidal ideation, hemolytic anemia, suppression of bone marrow function, autoimmune and infectious disorders, ophthalmologic disorders, cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary dysfunction, colitis, pancreatitis, and diabetes. The PEGASYS \u00ae Package Insert should be reviewed in its entirety for additional safety information prior to initiation of combination treatment. Birth defects and fetal death with ribavirin: Do not use in pregnancy and for 6 months after treatment. Patients must have a negative pregnancy test prior to therapy, use at least 2 forms of contraception and undergo monthly pregnancy tests (4 , 5.1 , 8.1) PEGASYS \u00ae /Ribavirin: Patients exhibiting the following conditions should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy: Hemolytic anemia may occur with a significant initial drop in hemoglobin. This may result in worsening cardiac disease leading to fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarctions (5.2 , 6.1) Risk of hepatic failure and death: Monitor hepatic function during treatment and discontinue treatment for hepatic decompensation (5.3) Severe hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and anaphylaxis, and serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (5.4) Pulmonary disorders, including pulmonary function impairment and pneumonitis, including fatal cases of pneumonia (5.5) Severe depression and suicidal ideation, autoimmune and infectious disorders, suppression of bone marrow function, pancreatitis, and diabetes (5) Bone marrow suppression with azathioprine coadministration (5.6) Growth impairment with combination therapy in pediatric patients (5.8) 5.1 Pregnancy Ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed fetus. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin. Ribavirin therapy should not be started unless a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of therapy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Patients should be instructed to use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after treatment has been stopped. Pregnancy testing should occur monthly during ribavirin therapy and for 6 months after therapy has stopped [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Anemia The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which was observed in approximately 13% of all ribavirin/PEGASYS \u00ae -treated subjects in clinical trials. Anemia associated with ribavirin occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy. Because the initial drop in hemoglobin may be significant, it is advised that hemoglobin or hematocrit be obtained pretreatment and at week 2 and week 4 of therapy or more frequently if clinically indicated. Patients should then be followed as clinically appropriate. Caution should be exercised in initiating treatment in any patient with baseline risk of severe anemia (e.g., spherocytosis, history of gastrointestinal bleeding) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions have been reported in patients with anemia caused by ribavirin. Patients should be assessed for underlying cardiac disease before initiation of ribavirin therapy. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment, and should be appropriately monitored during therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be suspended or discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug-induced anemia, patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use ribavirin [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Failure Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation and death when treated with alpha interferons, including PEGASYS \u00ae . Cirrhotic CHC patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In Study NR15961 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ], among 129 CHC/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs or the associated risk. During treatment, patients\u2019 clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation. Treatment with PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin should be discontinued immediately in patients with hepatic decompensation [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Severe acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and anaphylaxis) have been observed during alpha interferon and ribavirin therapy. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with PEGASYS \u00ae and ribavirin should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy instituted. Serious skin reactions including vesiculobullous eruptions, reactions in the spectrum of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme major) with varying degrees of skin and mucosal involvement and exfoliative dermatitis (erythroderma) have been reported in patients receiving PEGASYS \u00ae with and without ribavirin. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions must discontinue therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.5 Pulmonary Disorders Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia have been reported during therapy with ribavirin and interferon. Occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred. In addition, sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported. If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment, patients should be closely monitored and, if appropriate, combination ribavirin/PEGASYS \u00ae treatment should be discontinued. 5.6 Bone Marrow Suppression Pancytopenia (marked decreases in RBCs, neutrophils and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited number of patients (n=8), myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. PEGASYS \u00ae , ribavirin, and azathioprine should be discontinued for pancytopenia, and pegylated interferon/ribavirin should not be re-introduced with concomitant azathioprine [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.7 Pancreatitis Ribavirin and PEGASYS \u00ae therapy should be suspended in patients with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. 5.8 Impact on Growth in Pediatric Patients During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with PEGASYS \u00ae plus ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed in pediatric subjects 5 to 17 years of age. Decreases in weight for age z-score and height for age z-score up to 48 weeks of therapy compared with baseline were observed. At 2 years post-treatment, 16% of pediatric subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 11% were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve. The available longer term data on subjects who were followed up to 6 years post-treatment are too limited to determine the risk of reduced adult height in some patients [see Clinical Studies Experience (6.1) ]. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Before beginning PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin combination therapy, standard hematological and biochemical laboratory tests are recommended for all patients. Pregnancy screening for women of childbearing potential must be performed. Patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment with PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin. After initiation of therapy, hematological tests should be performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks and biochemical tests should be performed at 4 weeks. Additional testing should be performed periodically during therapy. In adult clinical studies, the CBC (including hemoglobin level and white blood cell and platelet counts) and chemistries (including liver function tests and uric acid) were measured at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, and then every 4 to 6 weeks or more frequently if abnormalities were found. In the pediatric clinical trial, hematological and chemistry assessments were at 1, 3, 5, and 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured every 12 weeks. Monthly pregnancy testing should be performed during combination therapy and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy. The entrance criteria used for the clinical studies of ribavirin and PEGASYS \u00ae may be considered as a guideline to acceptable baseline values for initiation of treatment: Platelet count greater than or equal to 90,000 cells/mm 3 (as low as 75,000 cells/mm 3 in HCV patients with cirrhosis or 70,000 cells/mm 3 in patients with CHC and HIV) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500 cells/mm 3 TSH and T 4 within normal limits or adequately controlled thyroid function CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm 3 or CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm 3 but less than 200 cells/mm 3 and HIV-1 RNA less than 5,000 copies/mL in patients coinfected with HIV Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g/dL for women and greater than or equal to 13 g/dL for men in CHC monoinfected patients Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 11 g/dL for women and greater than or equal to 12 g/dL for men in patients with CHC and HIV"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin causes a broad variety of serious adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . The most common serious or life-threatening adverse reactions induced or aggravated by ribavirin/PEGASYS \u00ae include depression, suicide, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, and bacterial infections each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Hepatic decompensation occurred in 2% (10/574) CHC/HIV patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . The most common adverse reactions (frequency greater than 40%) in adults receiving combination therapy are fatigue/asthenia, pyrexia, myalgia, and headache. (6.1) The most common adverse reactions in pediatric subjects were similar to those seen in adults. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adult Patients In the pivotal registration trials NV15801 and NV15942, 886 patients received ribavirin for 48 weeks at doses of 1000/1200 mg based on body weight. In these trials, one or more serious adverse reactions occurred in 10% of CHC monoinfected subjects and in 19% of CHC/HIV subjects receiving PEGASYS \u00ae alone or in combination with ribavirin. The most common serious adverse event (3% in CHC and 5% in CHC/HIV) was bacterial infection (e.g., sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia). Other serious adverse reactions occurred at a frequency of less than 1% and included: suicide, suicidal ideation, psychosis, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic disorder, and hallucination. The percentage of patients in clinical trials who experienced one or more adverse events was 98%. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were psychiatric reactions, including depression, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, headache and rigors. Other common reactions were anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus. Table 5 shows rates of adverse events occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy in the CHC Clinical Trial, NV15801. Ten percent of CHC monoinfected patients receiving 48 weeks of therapy with PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin discontinued therapy; 16% of CHC/HIV coinfected patients discontinued therapy. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy were psychiatric, flu-like syndrome (e.g., lethargy, fatigue, headache), dermatologic and gastrointestinal disorders, and laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia). Overall 39% of patients with CHC or CHC/HIV required modification of PEGASYS \u00ae and/or ribavirin therapy. The most common reason for dose modification of PEGASYS \u00ae in CHC and CHC/HIV patients was for laboratory abnormalities; neutropenia (20% and 27%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (4% and 6%, respectively). The most common reason for dose modification of ribavirin in CHC and CHC/HIV patients was anemia (22% and 16%, respectively). PEGASYS \u00ae dose was reduced in 12% of patients receiving 1000 mg to 1200 mg ribavirin for 48 weeks and in 7% of patients receiving 800 mg ribavirin for 24 weeks. Ribavirin dose was reduced in 21% of patients receiving 1000 mg to 1200 mg ribavirin for 48 weeks and in 12% of patients receiving 800 mg ribavirin for 24 weeks. Chronic hepatitis C monoinfected patients treated for 24 weeks with PEGASYS \u00ae and 800 mg ribavirin were observed to have lower incidence of serious adverse events (3% vs. 10%), hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL (3% vs. 15%), dose modification of PEGASYS \u00ae (30% vs. 36%) and ribavirin (19% vs. 38%), and of withdrawal from treatment (5% vs. 15%) compared to patients treated for 48 weeks with PEGASYS \u00ae and 1000 mg or 1200 mg ribavirin. On the other hand, the overall incidence of adverse events appeared to be similar in the two treatment groups.

In general, the safety profile observed in pediatric subjects was similar to that seen in adults. In the pediatric study, the most common adverse events in subjects treated with combination therapy PEGASYS \u00ae and ribavirin for up to 48 weeks were influenza-like illness (91%), upper respiratory tract infection (60%), headache (64%), gastrointestinal disorder (56%), skin disorder (47%), and injection-site reaction (45%). Seven subjects receiving combination PEGASYS \u00ae and ribavirin treatment for 48 weeks discontinued therapy for safety reasons (depression, psychiatric evaluation abnormal, transient blindness, retinal exudates, hyperglycemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and anemia). Severe adverse events were reported in 2 subjects in the PEGASYS \u00ae plus ribavirin combination therapy group (hyperglycemia and cholecystectomy).

Pediatric subjects treated with PEGASYS \u00ae plus ribavirin combination therapy showed a delay in weight and height increases with up to 48 weeks of therapy compared with baseline. Both weight for age and height for age z-scores as well as the percentiles of the normative population for subject weight and height decreased during treatment. At the end of 2 years follow-up after treatment, most subjects had returned to baseline normative curve percentiles for weight (64 th mean percentile at baseline, 60 th mean percentile at 2 years post-treatment) and height (54 th mean percentile at baseline, 56 th mean percentile at 2 years post-treatment). At the end of treatment, 43% (23 of 53) of subjects experienced a weight percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles, and 25% (13 of 53) experienced a height percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles on the normative growth curves. At 2 years post-treatment, 16% (6 of 38) of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 11% (4 of 38) were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve. Thirty-eight of the 114 subjects enrolled in the long-term follow-up study, extending up to 6 years post-treatment. For most subjects, post-treatment recovery in growth at 2 years post-treatment was maintained to 6 years post-treatment. Common Adverse Reactions in CHC with HIV Coinfection (Adults) The adverse event profile of coinfected patients treated with PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin in Study NR15961 was generally similar to that shown for monoinfected patients in Study NV15801 ( Table 5 ). Events occurring more frequently in coinfected patients were neutropenia (40%), anemia (14%), thrombocytopenia (8%), weight decrease (16%), and mood alteration (9%). Laboratory Test Abnormalities Adult Patients Anemia due to hemolysis is the most significant toxicity of ribavirin therapy. Anemia (hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL) was observed in 13% of all ribavirin and PEGASYS \u00ae combination-treated patients in clinical trials. The maximum drop in hemoglobin occurred during the first 8 weeks of initiation of ribavirin therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Most laboratory abnormalities noted during the clinical trial returned to baseline levels shortly after discontinuation of treatment. Table 8 Selected Hematologic Abnormalities During First 24 Weeks of Treatment by Treatment Group in Previously Untreated Pediatric Subjects * Subjects in the PEGASYS \u00ae plus placebo arm who did not achieve undetectable viral load at week 24 switched to combination treatment thereafter. Therefore, only the first 24 weeks are presented for the comparison of combination therapy with monotherapy.

The majority of hematologic abnormalities occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during post-approval use of PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin combination therapy. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System disorders Pure red cell aplasia Ear and Labyrinth disorders Hearing impairment, hearing loss Eye disorders Serous retinal detachment Immune disorders Liver and renal graft rejection Metabolism and Nutrition disorders Dehydration Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue disorders Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Results from a pharmacokinetic sub-study demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interaction between PEGASYS \u00ae (peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin. Nucleoside analogues: Closely monitor for toxicities. Discontinue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or reduce dose or discontinue interferon, ribavirin or both with worsening toxicities (7.1) Azathioprine: Concomitant use of azathioprine with ribavirin has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity (7.3) 7.1 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HCV/HIV coinfected patients. In Study NR15961 among the CHC/HIV coinfected cirrhotic patients receiving NRTIs, cases of hepatic decompensation (some fatal) were observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Patients receiving PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS \u00ae , ribavirin or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than or equal to 6) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Didanosine Coadministration of ribavirin and didanosine is contraindicated. Didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate) concentrations are increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities. Reports of fatal hepatic failure as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials [see Contraindications (4) ] . Zidovudine In Study NR15961, patients who were administered zidovudine in combination with PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin developed severe neutropenia (ANC less than 500) and severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL) more frequently than similar patients not receiving zidovudine (neutropenia 15% vs. 9%) (anemia 5% vs. 1%). Discontinuation of zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. 7.2 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin does not inhibit CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4. 7.3 Azathioprine The use of ribavirin to treat chronic hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate (6-MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatrics: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients less than 5 years old have not been established (8.4) Renal Impairment: Dose should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min (8.7) Organ Transplant: Safety and efficacy have not been studied (8.10) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy: Category X [see Contraindications (4) ] . Ribavirin produced significant embryocidal and/or teratogenic effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose. Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In conventional embryotoxicity/teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits, observed no-effect dose levels were well below those for proposed clinical use (0.3 mg/kg/day for both the rat and rabbit; approximately 0.06 times the recommended daily human dose of ribavirin). No maternal toxicity or effects on offspring were observed in a peri/postnatal toxicity study in rats dosed orally at up to 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.01 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of ribavirin). Treatment and Post-Treatment: Potential Risk to the Fetus Ribavirin is known to accumulate in intracellular components from where it is cleared very slowly. It is not known whether ribavirin is contained in sperm, and if so, will exert a potential teratogenic effect upon fertilization of the ova. However, because of the potential human teratogenic effects of ribavirin, male patients should be advised to take every precaution to avoid risk of pregnancy for their female partners. Ribavirin should not be used by pregnant women or by men whose female partners are pregnant. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless the patient and his/her partner are using effective contraception (two reliable forms) during therapy and for 6 months post therapy [see Contraindications (4) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ribavirin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and to avoid any potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ribavirin, a decision should be made either to discontinue nursing or therapy with ribavirin, based on the importance of the therapy to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Pharmacokinetic evaluations in pediatric patients have not been performed. Safety and effectiveness of ribavirin have not been established in patients below the age of 5 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ribavirin and PEGASYS \u00ae did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations for ribavirin in the elderly have not been performed. The risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. The dose of ribavirin should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min; and the dose of PEGASYS \u00ae should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 8.6 Race A pharmacokinetic study in 42 subjects demonstrated there is no clinically significant difference in ribavirin pharmacokinetics among Black (n=14), Hispanic (n=13) and Caucasian (n=15) subjects. 8.7 Renal Impairment Renal function should be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of ribavirin by estimating the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance. A clinical trial evaluated treatment with ribavirin and PEGASYS \u00ae in 50 CHC subjects with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). In 18 subjects with ESRD receiving chronic HD, ribavirin was administered at a dose of 200 mg daily with no apparent difference in the adverse event profile in comparison to subjects with normal renal function. Dose reductions and temporary interruptions of ribavirin (due to ribavirin-related adverse reactions, mainly anemia) were observed in up to one-third ESRD/HD subjects during treatment; and only one-third of these subjects received ribavirin for 48 weeks. Ribavirin plasma exposures were approximately 20% lower in subjects with ESRD on HD compared to subjects with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose. Subjects with moderate (n=17) or severe (n=14) renal impairment did not tolerate 600 mg or 400 mg daily doses of ribavirin, respectively, due to ribavirin-related adverse reactions, mainly anemia, and exhibited 20% to 30% higher ribavirin plasma exposures (despite frequent dose modifications) compared to subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min) receiving the standard dose of ribavirin. Discontinuation rates were higher in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to that observed in subjects with moderate renal impairment or normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicate that a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with severe renal impairment and a dose of 200 mg daily alternating with 400 mg the following day in patients with moderate renal impairment will provide plasma ribavirin exposure similar to patients with normal renal function receiving the approved regimen of ribavirin. These doses have not been studied in patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Based on the pharmacokinetic and safety results from this trial, patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min should receive a reduced dose of ribavirin; and patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min should receive a reduced dose of PEGASYS \u00ae . The clinical and hematologic status of patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min receiving ribavirin should be carefully monitored. Patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or adverse reactions which are persistently severe or worsening should have therapy withdrawn [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and PEGASYS \u00ae Package Insert] . 8.8 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin following administration of ribavirin has not been evaluated. The clinical trials of ribavirin were restricted to patients with Child-Pugh class A disease. 8.9 Gender No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were observed between male and female subjects. Ribavirin pharmacokinetics, when corrected for weight, are similar in male and female patients. 8.10 Organ Transplant Recipients The safety and efficacy of PEGASYS \u00ae and ribavirin treatment have not been established in patients with liver and other transplantations. As with other alpha interferons, liver and renal graft rejections have been reported on PEGASYS \u00ae , alone or in combination with ribavirin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ribavirin is an antiviral drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Multiple dose ribavirin pharmacokinetic data are available for HCV patients who received ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a. Following administration of 1200 mg/day with food for 12 weeks mean\u00b1SD (n=39; body weight greater than 75 kg) AUC 0-12 hr was 25,361\u00b17110 ng\u00b7hr/mL and C max was 2748\u00b1818 ng/mL. The average time to reach C max was 2 hours. Trough ribavirin plasma concentrations following 12 weeks of dosing with food were 1662\u00b1545 ng/mL in HCV infected patients who received 800 mg/day (n=89), and 2112\u00b1810 ng/mL in patients who received 1200 mg/day (n=75; body weight greater than 75 kg). The terminal half-life of ribavirin following administration of a single oral dose of ribavirin is about 120 to 170 hours. The total apparent clearance following administration of a single oral dose of ribavirin is about 26 L/h. There is extensive accumulation of ribavirin after multiple dosing (twice daily) such that the C max at steady state was four-fold higher than that of a single dose. Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin Bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by coadministration with a high-fat meal. The absorption was slowed (T max was doubled) and the AUC 0-192 h and C max increased by 42% and 66%, respectively, when ribavirin was taken with a high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Elimination and Metabolism The contribution of renal and hepatic pathways to ribavirin elimination after administration of ribavirin is not known. In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes. Renal Impairment A clinical trial evaluated 50 CHC subjects with either moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). The apparent clearance of ribavirin was reduced in subjects with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min, including subjects with ESRD on HD, exhibiting approximately 30% of the value found in subjects with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicates that a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with severe renal impairment and a dose of 200 mg daily alternating with 400 mg the following day in patients with moderate renal impairment will provide plasma ribavirin exposures similar to that observed in patients with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose. These doses have not been studied in patients. In 18 subjects with ESRD receiving chronic HD, ribavirin was administered at a dose of 200 mg daily. Ribavirin plasma exposures in these subjects were approximately 20% lower compared to subjects with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Plasma ribavirin is removed by hemodialysis with an extraction ratio of approximately 50%; however, due to the large volume of distribution of ribavirin, plasma exposure is not expected to change with hemodialysis. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which ribavirin contributes to its antiviral efficacy in the clinic is not fully understood. Ribavirin has direct antiviral activity in tissue culture against many RNA viruses. Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical reaction. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture In the stable HCV cell culture model system (HCV replicon), ribavirin inhibited autonomous HCV RNA replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) value of 11 to 21 mcM. In the same model, PEG-IFN \u03b1-2a also inhibited HCV RNA replication, with an EC 50 value of 0.1 to 3 ng/mL. The combination of PEG-IFN \u03b1-2a and ribavirin was more effective at inhibiting HCV RNA replication than either agent alone. Resistance Different HCV genotypes display considerable clinical variability in their response to PEG-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy. Viral genetic determinants associated with the variable response have not been definitively identified. Cross-resistance Cross-resistance between IFN \u03b1 and ribavirin has not been observed."

Renal Impairment A clinical trial evaluated 50 CHC subjects with either moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). The apparent clearance of ribavirin was reduced in subjects with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min, including subjects with ESRD on HD, exhibiting approximately 30% of the value found in subjects with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicates that a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with severe renal impairment and a dose of 200 mg daily alternating with 400 mg the following day in patients with moderate renal impairment will provide plasma ribavirin exposures similar to that observed in patients with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose. These doses have not been studied in patients. In 18 subjects with ESRD receiving chronic HD, ribavirin was administered at a dose of 200 mg daily. Ribavirin plasma exposures in these subjects were approximately 20% lower compared to subjects with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Plasma ribavirin is removed by hemodialysis with an extraction ratio of approximately 50%; however, due to the large volume of distribution of ribavirin, plasma exposure is not expected to change with hemodialysis."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a p53 (+/-) mouse carcinogenicity study up to the maximum tolerated dose of 100 mg/kg/day, ribavirin was not oncogenic. Ribavirin was also not oncogenic in a rat 2-year carcinogenicity study at doses up to the maximum tolerated dose of 60 mg/kg/day. On a body surface area basis, these doses are approximately 0.5 and 0.6 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of ribavirin, respectively. Mutagenesis Ribavirin demonstrated mutagenic activity in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. No clastogenic activity was observed in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. However, results from studies published in the literature show clastogenic activity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg. A dominant lethal assay in rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male gametes. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study in rats, ribavirin showed a marginal reduction in sperm counts at the dose of 100 mg/kg/day with no effect on fertility. Upon cessation of treatment, total recovery occurred after 1 spermatogenesis cycle. Abnormalities in sperm were observed in studies in mice designed to evaluate the time course and reversibility of ribavirin-induced testicular degeneration at doses of 15 to 150 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 to 0.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of ribavirin) administered for 3 to 6 months. Upon cessation of treatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity was apparent within 1 or 2 spermatogenic cycles. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless the patient and his/her partner are using effective contraception (two reliable forms). Based on a multiple dose half-life (t 1/2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days, effective contraception must be utilized for 6 months post therapy (i.e., 15 half-lives of clearance for ribavirin). No reproductive toxicology studies have been performed using PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin. However, peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin when administered separately, each has adverse effects on reproduction. It should be assumed that the effects produced by either agent alone would also be caused by the combination of the two agents. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In a study in rats, it was concluded that dominant lethality was not induced by ribavirin at doses up to 200 mg/kg for 5 days (up to 1.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of ribavirin). Long-term studies in the mouse and rat (18 to 24 months; dose 20 to 75, and 10 to 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, approximately 0.1 to 0.4 times the maximum daily human dose of ribavirin) have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and an increased incidence of vascular lesions (microscopic hemorrhages) in mice. In rats, retinal degeneration occurred in controls, but the incidence was increased in ribavirin-treated rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Adult Patients The safety and effectiveness of PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection were assessed in two randomized controlled clinical trials. All patients were adults, had compensated liver disease, detectable hepatitis C virus, liver biopsy diagnosis of chronic hepatitis, and were previously untreated with interferon. Approximately 20% of patients in both studies had compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A). Patients coinfected with HIV were excluded from these studies. In Study NV15801, patients were randomized to receive either PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg subcutaneous once weekly with an oral placebo, PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg once weekly with ribavirin 1000 mg by mouth (body weight less than 75 kg) or 1200 mg by mouth (body weight greater than or equal to 75 kg) or interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU subcutaneous three times a week plus ribavirin 1000 mg or 1200 mg by mouth. All patients received 48 weeks of therapy followed by 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Ribavirin or placebo treatment assignment was blinded. Sustained virological response was defined as undetectable (less than 50 IU/mL) HCV RNA on or after study week 68. PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin resulted in a higher SVR compared to PEGASYS \u00ae alone or interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin ( Table 9 ). In all treatment arms, patients with viral genotype 1, regardless of viral load, had a lower response rate to PEGASYS \u00ae in combination with ribavirin compared to patients with other viral genotypes. Table 9 Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) to Combination Therapy (Study NV15801) Interferon alfa-2b + Ribavirin 1000 mg or 1200 mg PEGASYS \u00ae + Placebo PEGASYS \u00ae + Ribavirin 1000 mg or 1200 mg All patients 197/444 (44%) 65/224 (29%) 241/453 (53%) Genotype 1 103/285 (36%) 29/145 (20%) 132/298 (44%) Genotypes 2 to 6 94/159 (59%) 36/79 (46%) 109/155 (70%) Difference in overall treatment response (PEGASYS \u00ae /ribavirin \u2013 Interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin) was 9% (95% CI 2.3, 15.3). In Study NV15942, all patients received PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg subcutaneous once weekly and were randomized to treatment for either 24 or 48 weeks and to a ribavirin dose of either 800 mg or 1000 mg/1200 mg (for body weight less than 75 kg/greater than or equal to 75 kg). Assignment to the four treatment arms was stratified by viral genotype and baseline HCV viral titer. Patients with genotype 1 and high viral titer (defined as greater than 2 x 10 6 HCV RNA copies/mL serum) were preferentially assigned to treatment for 48 weeks. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) and HCV Genotype HCV 1 and 4 - Irrespective of baseline viral titer, treatment for 48 weeks with PEGASYS \u00ae and 1000 mg or 1200 mg of ribavirin resulted in higher SVR (defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of the 24-week treatment-free follow-up period) compared to shorter treatment (24 weeks) and/or 800 mg ribavirin. HCV 2 and 3 - Irrespective of baseline viral titer, treatment for 24 weeks with PEGASYS \u00ae and 800 mg of ribavirin resulted in a similar SVR compared to longer treatment (48 weeks) and/or 1000 mg or 1200 mg of ribavirin (see Table 10 ). The numbers of patients with genotype 5 and 6 were too few to allow for meaningful assessment.

All subjects were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable (less than 50 IU/mL) HCV RNA on or after study week 68. A total of 114 subjects were randomized to receive either combination treatment of ribavirin plus PEGASYS \u00ae or PEGASYS \u00ae monotherapy; subjects failing PEGASYS \u00ae monotherapy at 24 weeks or later could receive open-label ribavirin plus PEGASYS \u00ae . The initial randomized arms were balanced for demographic factors; 55 subjects received initial combination treatment of ribavirin plus PEGASYS \u00ae and 59 received PEGASYS \u00ae plus placebo; in the overall intent-to-treat population, 45% were female, 80% were Caucasian, and 81% were infected with HCV genotype 1. The SVR results are summarized in Table 11.

In studies NV15801 and NV15942, treatment response rates were lower in patients older than 40 years (50% vs. 66%), in patients with cirrhosis (47% vs. 59%), in patients weighing over 85 kg (49% vs. 60%), and in patients with genotype 1 with high vs. low viral load (43% vs. 56%). African-American patients had lower response rates compared to Caucasians. In studies NV15801 and NV15942, lack of early virologic response by 12 weeks (defined as HCV RNA undetectable or greater than 2 log 10 lower than baseline) was grounds for discontinuation of treatment. Of patients who lacked an early viral response by 12 weeks and completed a recommended course of therapy despite a protocol-defined option to discontinue therapy, 5/39 (13%) achieved an SVR. Of patients who lacked an early viral response by 24 weeks, 19 completed a full course of therapy and none achieved an SVR. 14.3 Chronic Hepatitis C/HIV Coinfected Patients In Study NR15961, patients with CHC/HIV were randomized to receive either PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg subcutaneous once weekly plus an oral placebo, PEGASYS \u00ae 180 mcg once weekly plus ribavirin 800 mg by mouth daily or interferon alfa-2a, 3 MIU subcutaneous three times a week plus ribavirin 800 mg by mouth daily. All patients received 48 weeks of therapy and sustained virologic response (SVR) was assessed at 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Ribavirin or placebo treatment assignment was blinded in the PEGASYS \u00ae treatment arms. All patients were adults, had compensated liver disease, detectable hepatitis C virus, liver biopsy diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C, and were previously untreated with interferon. Patients also had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm 3 or CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm 3 but less than 200 cells/mm 3 and HIV-1 RNA less than 5000 copies/mL, and stable status of HIV. Approximately 15% of patients in the study had cirrhosis. Results are shown in Table 12. Table 12 Sustained Virologic Response in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Coinfected With HIV (Study NR15961) Interferon alfa-2a + Ribavirin 800 mg (N=289) PEGASYS \u00ae + Placebo (N=289) PEGASYS \u00ae + Ribavirin 800 mg (N=290) All patients 33 (11%) 58 (20%) 116 (40%) Genotype 1 12/171 (7%) 24/175 (14%) 51/176 (29%) Genotypes 2, 3 18/89 (20%) 32/90 (36%) 59/95 (62%) Treatment response rates were lower in CHC/HIV patients with poor prognostic factors (including HCV genotype 1, HCV RNA greater than 800,000 IU/mL, and cirrhosis) receiving pegylated interferon alpha therapy. Of the patients who did not demonstrate either undetectable HCV RNA or at least a 2 log 10 reduction from baseline in HCV RNA titer by 12 weeks of PEGASYS \u00ae and ribavirin combination therapy, 2% (2/85) achieved an SVR. In CHC patients with HIV coinfection who received 48 weeks of PEGASYS \u00ae alone or in combination with ribavirin treatment, mean and median HIV RNA titers did not increase above baseline during treatment or 24 weeks post-treatment."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) Pregnancy Patients must be informed that ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed fetus. Ribavirin therapy must not be used by women who are pregnant or by men whose female partners are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients taking ribavirin therapy and for 6 months post therapy. Patients should use two reliable methods of birth control while taking ribavirin therapy and for 6 months post therapy. Ribavirin therapy should not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. Patients must perform a pregnancy test monthly during therapy and for 6 months post therapy. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must be advised of the teratogenic/embryocidal risks and must be instructed to practice effective contraception during ribavirin therapy and for 6 months post therapy. Patients should be advised to notify the healthcare provider immediately in the event of a pregnancy [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Anemia The most common adverse event associated with ribavirin is anemia, which may be severe [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .
