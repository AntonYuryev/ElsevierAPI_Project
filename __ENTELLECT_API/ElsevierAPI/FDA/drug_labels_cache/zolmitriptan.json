      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Limitations of Use Only use ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY have not been established for cluster headache. Not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older (1) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1) Not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period (2.1) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose for ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of ZOLMITRIPTAN NASAL SPRAY to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7 , 7.5) Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events (5.8) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive zolmitriptan [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue zolmitriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. Zolmitriptan should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Zolmitriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were: Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia (6.1) Pediatrics: unusual taste (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for zolmitriptan nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=224) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either zolmitriptan nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using zolmitriptan 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one-year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of zolmitriptan nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan nasal spray is similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray (see zolmitriptan tablet/zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablet Prescribing Information) . Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving zolmitriptan compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg zolmitriptan dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

(2.3 , 7.4) 7.1 Ergot-containing drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there are a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After oral administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there are a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with zolmitriptan should continue for at least 15 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg and 5 mg in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In Study 1, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing. Pain-free response rates and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. A dose of escape medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. In Study 1, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 83% were female and 99% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 65 years). The two-hour headache response rates in patients treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray were significantly higher among patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray at all doses, compared with placebo (see Table 3). Table 3: First Attack Data: Percentage of Adult Patients with Headache Response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Study 1 PLACEBO (N=218) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=219) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=228) 31% 55%* 69%* *p < 0.001 in comparison with placebo The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response after treatment in Study 1 Note: Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (moderate or severe headache improving to mild or no pain) following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. The estimates displayed are based on a placebo controlled, outpatient trial providing evidence of efficacy. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored to 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray as compared with placebo. Four to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Estimated probability of patients taking an escape medication within the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 1 *This Kaplan-Meier plot is based on data obtained from the placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. It should be noted that the protocol did not allow remedication within 4 hours post dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; presence of headache upon awakening, relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; or presence of pre-treatment nausea. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was further supported by an interim analysis of another similarly designed trial. The 2-hour headache response rates for the first 210 subjects in that study for zolmitriptan 5 mg and placebo were 70% and 47%, respectively (N=108 and 102, respectively, p=0.0006). Figure 1 Figure 2 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in pediatrics patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind run-in period. Patients had to have an established diagnosis of migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura with a typical untreated migraine headache attack lasting 3 hours or more. The study included treatment of a single migraine headache attack with 1 dose of single-blind placebo during the 30-day run-in period. If the patient met all conditions for randomization, including a lack of response to the placebo run-in, a subsequent single migraine headache attack was treated with 1 blinded dose of either zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg, 2.5 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 2, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 62% were female and 93% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 14 years (range 12 to 17 years). Study 2 evaluated the proportion of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who had no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment. Headache response (defined as a reduction in migraine-related headache pain severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) and the absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours post treatment were also assessed. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment was significantly higher for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg than placebo.

Limitations of Use: Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets , particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials* * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan tablets : In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets: The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablets dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with acute overdose of zolmitriptan tablets. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan tablets commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablets. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablets administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablets dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 - 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablets and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablets administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan(AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET \u00ae ); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae ,WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. You can also contact FDA to report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan is serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24 hour period ( 2.1 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00cfve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablet doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] ."

Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials * * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan tablets and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of ZOLMITRIPTAN Tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%- 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Zolmitriptan Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Zolmitriptan Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment: After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablets dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan tablets commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Zolmitriptan tablets are selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5HT 1B/1D ) receptor agonists. Zolmitriptan is chemically designated as (S)-4-[[3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-5yl]methyl]-2-oxazolidinone and has the following chemical structure: The empirical formula is C 16 H 21 N 3 O 2 representing a molecular weight of 287.36. Zolmitriptan is a white to off-white powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dimethylsulfoxide, insoluble in water. Zolmitriptan tablets are available as 2.5 mg (yellow and functionally-score) and 5 mg (pink, not scored) film coated tablets for oral administration. The film coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate, titanium dioxide, yellow iron oxide, and red iron oxide.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablets administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablet dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan tablet dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5 fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablet and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablet administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Zolmitriptan was administered to mice and rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Mice were dosed for 85 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females); rats were dosed for 101 weeks (males) and 86 weeks (females). There was no evidence of drug-induced tumors in mice at plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 700 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. In rats, there was an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in male rats receiving 400 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC approximately 700 times that in humans at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Zolmitriptan was positive in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Zolmitriptan was negative in an in vitro mammalian gene cell mutation (CHO/HGPRT) assay and in oral in vivo mouse micronucleus assays in mouse and rat. Impairment of Fertility Studies of male and female rats administered zolmitriptan prior to and during mating and up to implantation showed no impairment of fertility at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The plasma exposure (AUC) at this dose was approximately 3000 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Studies 1 through 5 n = number of patients randomized * p<0.05 in comparison with placebo. c p<0.05 in comparison with 1 mg. a Study 1 was the only study in which patients treated the headache in a clinic setting. b Study 4 was the only study where patients were excluded who had previously used sumatriptan.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability Of Patients Taking A Second Dose Or Other Medication For Migraines Over The 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose Of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Zolmitriptan Tablets ( ZOLE mi TRIP tan) 2.5 mg and 5 mg Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How do zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \"triptans\" like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if Zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using Zolmitriptan Tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose anytime after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets : severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Limitations of Use: \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. \u2022 Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose for zolmitriptan nasal spray in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to zolmitriptan nasal spray may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of zolmitriptan nasal spray in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.5 ) \u2022 Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue zolmitriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. Zolmitriptan should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Zolmitriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were: \u2022 Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatrics: unusual taste ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for zolmitriptan nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=224) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either zolmitriptan nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using zolmitriptan 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one-year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of zolmitriptan nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan nasal spray is similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [ see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving zolmitriptan compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg zolmitriptan dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

( 2.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.5 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and triptans [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there is a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After oral administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg and 5 mg in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In Study 1, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing. Pain-free response rates and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. A dose of escape medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. In Study 1, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 83% were female and 99% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 65 years). The two-hour headache response rates in patients treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray were significantly higher among patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray at all doses, compared with placebo (see Table 3). Table 3: First Attack Data: Percentage of Adult Patients with Headache Response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Study 1 PLACEBO (N=218) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=219) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=228) 31% 55%* 69%* *p < 0.001 in comparison with placebo The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response after treatment in Study 1 Note: Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (moderate or severe headache improving to mild or no pain) following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. The estimates displayed are based on a placebo controlled, outpatient trial providing evidence of efficacy. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored to 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray as compared with placebo. Four to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Estimated probability of patients taking an escape medication within the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 1 *This Kaplan-Meier plot is based on data obtained from the placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. It should be noted that the protocol did not allow remedication within 4 hours post dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; presence of headache upon awakening, relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; or presence of pre-treatment nausea. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was further supported by an interim analysis of another similarly designed trial. The 2-hour headache response rates for the first 210 subjects in that study for zolmitriptan 5 mg and placebo were 70% and 47%, respectively (N=108 and 102, respectively, p=0.0006). Figure 1 Figure 2 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in pediatrics patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind run-in period. Patients had to have an established diagnosis of migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura with a typical untreated migraine headache attack lasting 3 hours or more. The study included treatment of a single migraine headache attack with 1 dose of single-blind placebo during the 30-day run-in period. If the patient met all conditions for randomization, including a lack of response to the placebo run-in, a subsequent single migraine headache attack was treated with 1 blinded dose of either zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg, 2.5 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 2, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 62% were female and 93% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 14 years (range 12 to 17 years). Study 2 evaluated the proportion of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who had no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment. Headache response (defined as a reduction in migraine-related headache pain severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) and the absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours post treatment were also assessed. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment was significantly higher for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg than placebo. Table 4: Percentage of Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age with No Headache Pain, With Headache Response, No Nausea, No Photophobia, and No Phonophobia Two Hours after Treatment in Study 2 Two Hours Following Treatment Placebo (N=253) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=229) No Headache Pain 17% 25% 30%* With Headache Response 39% 53%* 51%* No Photophobia 44% 66%* 56%* No Phonophobia 48% 61%* 58%* No Nausea 66% 70% 72% *p < 0.05 in comparison with placebo Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use their usual medication for pain relief. The estimated probability of patients taking escape medication during the first 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 3.

Peel back the tab to remove the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray unit from the plastic pack (See Figure A). Step 4. Keeping your head in an upright position, gently close 1 nostril with your index finger and breathe out gently through your mouth. (See Figure B). Either nostril can be used. Step 5. With your other hand, hold the container with your thumb supporting the container at the bottom, and your index and middle fingers on each side of the nozzle. (See Figure C). Insert the tip of the sprayer device into your open nostril as far as feels comfortable and tilt your head slightly (See Figure D). Do not press the plunger yet. Step 6. Breathe in gently through your nose and at the same time press the plunger firmly with your thumb to release your dose of Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray ( See Figure D ). The plunger may feel stiff and you may hear a click. Keep your head slightly tilted back and remove the tip from your nose. Breathe gently through your mouth for 5 to 10 seconds. You may feel liquid in your nose or the back of your throat. This is normal. Step 7. Dispose the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray device after completing the full dose or as soon as it becomes outdated or no longer needed. Dispose of properly. Keep out of reach of children. Do not reuse.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ seeDrug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. \u2022 Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials* Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest-pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw-pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other-Pressure/tightness/heaviness 0% 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ seeContraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0 to 4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2. Table 2: Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Studies 1 through 5 Placebo Zolmitriptan 1 mg Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg Zolmitriptan 5 mg Study 1* 16% (n \u2020 =19) 27% (n=22) NA \u2021 60% \u00a7\u00b6 (n=20) Study 2 19% (n=88) NA NA 66% \u00a7 (n=179) Study 3 34% (n=121) 50% \u00a7 (n=140) 65% \u00a7\u00b6 (n=260) 67% \u00a7\u00b6 (n=245) Study 4 # 44% (n=55) NA NA 59% \u00a7 (n=491) Study 5 36% (n=92) NA 62% \u00a7 (n=178) NA * Study 1 was the only study in which patients treated the headache in a clinic setting. \u2020 n = number of patients randomized \u2021 NA = not applicable \u00a7 P<0.05 in comparison with placebo. \u00b6 P<0.05 in comparison with 1 mg. # Study 4 was the only study where patients were excluded who had previously used sumatriptan. The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 4 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1 Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. figure1 figure2"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan (ZOLE-mi-TRIP-tan) Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How do zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: \u2022 Have heart disease or a history of heart disease \u2022 Have uncontrolled high blood pressure \u2022 Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) \u2022 Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation \u2022 Have serious liver problems \u2022 Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. \u2022 Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. \u2022 Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? \u2022 Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how many zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take them. \u2022 Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. \u2022 If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: \u2022 pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw \u2022 dizziness \u2022 tingling or other abnormal sensations \u2022 tiredness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 feeling warm or cold \u2022 nausea \u2022 feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body \u2022 dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets : \u2022 severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw \u2022 shortness of breath or wheezing \u2022 sudden or severe stomach pain \u2022 hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling \u2022 problems seeing \u2022 unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-\u00adhour period ( 2.1 ) Do not break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets ( 2.2 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6),and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptanorally disintegrating tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications (4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications (4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials 1 Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other- Pressure/tightness/heaviness 0 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% 1 Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 ) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactaton Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5\u00ad-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65\u201376 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N\u00ad-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7) , and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study.

Figure 1 Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability Of Patients Taking a Second Dose Or Other Medication For Migraines Over The 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose Of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets 2.5 mg was demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 6) that was similar in design to the trials of zolmitriptan tablets. Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Of the 471 patients treated in Study 6, 87% were female and 97% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18-62). At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets 2.5 mg with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%). The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3 Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 2 Hours in Study 6* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot patients taking additional treatment or not achieving headache response prior to 2 hours were censored at 2 hours. For patients with migraine-associated photophobia, phonophobia and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets as compared to placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 6 is summarized in Figure 4. Figure 4 The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines Over the 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Study 6* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not taking additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. Taking another dose of study medication was allowed 2 hours post-dose in Study 6. In contrast to studies of zolmitriptan tablets (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), Study 6 allowed re-dosing of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets prior to 4 hours. fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24\u00ad-hour period (2.1) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3 , 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1(844) 874-7464 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials * * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with acute overdose of zolmitriptan. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5-HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets, USP (zole\" mi trip' tan) Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take them. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.

If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicate for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period (2.1) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3, 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Arrthymias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials 1 Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other- Pressure/tightness/heaviness 0% 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% 1 Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There was no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There was insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, zolmitriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from zolmitriptan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet, with a median T max of 3 hours for orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly nonmigraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [ see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), and Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Estimated Probability Of Patients Taking A Second Dose Or Other Medication For Migraines Over The 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose Of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot,patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs.

Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction, Prinzmetal\u2019s angina, Other Vasospastic Reactions, and Cerebrovascular Events Inform patients that zolmitriptan may cause serious cardiovascular adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious cardiovascular reactions can occur without warning symptoms, instruct patients to be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and instruct them to ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if they have symptoms of other vasospastic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2, 5.4, 5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache Inform patients that use of drugs to treat acute migraines for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headache, and encourage patients to record headache frequency and drug use (e.g., by keeping a headache diary) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of zolmitriptan or other triptans, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Pregnancy Inform patients that zolmitriptan should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Nursing Mothers Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What is zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan is not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan work? Treatment with zolmitriptan reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan. Who should not take zolmitriptan? Do not take zolmitriptan if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \"triptans\" like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breast feeding, planning to breast feed, or not using effective birth control. How should I take zolmitriptan? Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose anytime after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined)in any 24-hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan are: Pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan. If you would like more information about zolmitriptan, talk to your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information on zolmitriptan that is written for healthcare professionals.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Limitations of Use: \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. \u2022 Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose for zolmitriptan nasal spray in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to zolmitriptan nasal spray may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of zolmitriptan nasal spray in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.5 ) \u2022 Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue zolmitriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. Zolmitriptan should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Zolmitriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were: \u2022 Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatrics: unusual taste ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for zolmitriptan nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=224) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either zolmitriptan nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using zolmitriptan 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one-year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of zolmitriptan nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan nasal spray is similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [ see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving zolmitriptan compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg zolmitriptan dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there is a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After oral administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with zolmitriptan should continue for at least 15 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg and 5 mg in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In Study 1, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing. Pain-free response rates and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. A dose of escape medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. In Study 1, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 83% were female and 99% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 65 years). The two-hour headache response rates in patients treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray were significantly higher among patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray at all doses, compared with placebo (see Table 3). Table 3: First Attack Data: Percentage of Adult Patients with Headache Response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Study 1 PLACEBO (N=218) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=219) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=228) 31% 55%* 69%* *p < 0.001 in comparison with placebo The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response after treatment in Study 1 Note: Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (moderate or severe headache improving to mild or no pain) following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. The estimates displayed are based on a placebo controlled, outpatient trial providing evidence of efficacy. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored to 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray as compared with placebo. Four to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Estimated probability of patients taking an escape medication within the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 1 *This Kaplan-Meier plot is based on data obtained from the placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. It should be noted that the protocol did not allow remedication within 4 hours post dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; presence of headache upon awakening, relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; or presence of pre-treatment nausea. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was further supported by an interim analysis of another similarly designed trial. The 2-hour headache response rates for the first 210 subjects in that study for zolmitriptan 5 mg and placebo were 70% and 47%, respectively (N=108 and 102, respectively, p=0.0006). 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in pediatrics patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind run-in period. Patients had to have an established diagnosis of migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura with a typical untreated migraine headache attack lasting 3 hours or more. The study included treatment of a single migraine headache attack with 1 dose of single-blind placebo during the 30-day run-in period. If the patient met all conditions for randomization, including a lack of response to the placebo run-in, a subsequent single migraine headache attack was treated with 1 blinded dose of either zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg, 2.5 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 2, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 62% were female and 93% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 14 years (range 12 to 17 years). Study 2 evaluated the proportion of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who had no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment. Headache response (defined as a reduction in migraine-related headache pain severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) and the absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours post treatment were also assessed. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment was significantly higher for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg than placebo. Table 4: Percentage of Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age with No Headache Pain, With Headache Response, No Nausea, No Photophobia, and No Phonophobia Two Hours after Treatment in Study 2 Two Hours Following Treatment Placebo (N=253) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=229) No Headache Pain 17% 25% 30%* With Headache Response 39% 53%* 51%* No Photophobia 44% 66%* 56%* No Phonophobia 48% 61%* 58%* No Nausea 66% 70% 72% *p < 0.05 in comparison with placebo Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use their usual medication for pain relief.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24 hour period ( 2.1 ) Do not break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets ( 2.2 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is coadministered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24 hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Disc33ontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) Patients with Phenylketonuria : Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.51 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 5.01 mg phenylalanine."

Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions ( > 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in > 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1 Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials* * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%- 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment: After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]."

Structural Formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablet s and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5-HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance.The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr > 5 < 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr > 26 < 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non -migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N- desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablet s and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5-HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance.The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr > 5 < 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr > 26 < 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non -migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N- desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.3 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Zolmitriptan was administered to mice and rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Mice were dosed for 85 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females); rats were dosed for 101 weeks (males) and 86 weeks (females). There was no evidence of drug-induced tumors in mice at plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 700 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. In rats, there was an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in male rats receiving 400 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC approximately 700 times that in humans at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Zolmitriptan was positive in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Zolmitriptan was negative in an in vitro mammalian gene cell mutation (CHO/HGPRT) assay and in oral in vivo mouse micronucleus assays in mouse and rat. Impairment of Fertility Studies of male and female rats administered zolmitriptan prior to and during mating and up to implantation showed no impairment of fertility at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The plasma exposure (AUC) at this dose was approximately 3000 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablets was demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 6) that was similar in design to the trials of zolmitriptan tablets. Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Of the 471 patients treated in Study 6, 87% were female and 97% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18-62). At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablets with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%). The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3 Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 2 Hours in Study 6* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients taking additional treatment or not achieving headache response prior to 2 hours were censored at 2 hours.

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan (zole'' mi trip' tan) Orally Disintegrating Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. Phenylketonurics Phenylketonurics is a component of aspartame. Each 2.5 mg zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.51 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mg zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains 5.01 mg phenylalanine. What is zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan is not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan work? Treatment with zolmitriptan reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan. Who should not take zolmitriptan? Do not take zolmitriptan if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \"triptans\" like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae* ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae* ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae* ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae* ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae* ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae* ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET \u00ae* ); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae* , CAFERGOT \u00ae* , ERGOMAR \u00ae* , WIGRAINE \u00ae* ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae* or MIGRANAL \u00ae* ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae* ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae* ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae* ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are sensitive to phenylalanine, which can be found in the artificial sweetener aspartame. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae* (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae* (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae* (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae* (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae* (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae* (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae* (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae* (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae* (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae* (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan? Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. If you take zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets, do not remove the tablet from the blister pack until you are ready to take your medicine. You do not need to take any liquids with your zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets. Take zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets whole. Place zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets on your tongue, where it will dissolve. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose anytime after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan : severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use : Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period (2.1) Do not break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets (2.2) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3, 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablet is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablet is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablet in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with: Ischemic coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), other significant underlying cardiovascular disease, or coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal\u2019s angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Ischemic bowel disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Uncontrolled hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Recent use (i.e., within 24 hours) of another 5-HT 1 agonist, ergotamine-containing medication, or ergot-type medication (such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide) [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3)]. Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor or recent use of a MAO-A inhibitor (that is within 2 weeks) [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Known hypersensitivity to zolmitriptan (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) Patients with Phenylketonuria : Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and >placebo) were neck/throat/ jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and >placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zol mitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged >65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablet dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4)]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4)]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablet was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 4 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablets was demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 6) that was similar in design to the trials of zolmitriptan tablets. Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Of the 471 patients treated in Study 6, 87% were female and 97% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 62). At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets 2.5 mg with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%). The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 2 Hours in Study 6* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot patients taking additional treatment or not achieving headache response prior to 2 hours were censored at 2 hours. For patients with migraine-associated photophobia, phonophobia and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets as compared to placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 6 is summarized in Figure 4. Figure 4: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Study 6 * *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not taking additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. Taking another dose of study medication was allowed 2 hours post-dose in Study 6. In contrast to studies of zolmitriptan tablets (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), Study 6 allowed re-dosing of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets prior to 4 hours. fig-1.jpg zolmitriptan-figure2.jpg fig-3.jpg fig-4.jpg"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan (ZOLE-mi-TRIP-tan) Orally Disintegrating Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What is zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan is not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan work? Treatment with zolmitriptan reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan. Who should not take zolmitriptan? Do not take zolmitriptan if you: \u2022Have heart disease or a history of heart disease \u2022Have uncontrolled high blood pressure \u2022Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) \u2022Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation \u2022Have serious liver problems \u2022Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET \u00ae ); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan. \u2022Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. \u2022Are allergic to zolmitriptan or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are sensitive to phenylalanine, which can be found in the artificial sweetener aspartame. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains phenylalanine. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan. How should I take zolmitriptan? \u2022Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. \u2022If you take zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets, do not remove the tablet from the blister pack until you are ready to take your medicine. \u2022You do not need to take any liquids with your zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets. \u2022Take zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets whole. \u2022Place zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets on your tongue, where it will dissolve. \u2022Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. \u2022If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined in any 24 hour period). If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan are: \u2022pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw \u2022dizziness \u2022tingling or other abnormal sensations \u2022tiredness \u2022drowsiness \u2022feeling warm or cold \u2022nausea \u2022feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body \u2022dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan: \u2022severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw \u2022shortness of breath or wheezing \u2022sudden or severe stomach pain \u2022hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling \u2022problems seeing \u2022unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan. If you would like more information about zolmitriptan, talk to your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information on zolmitriptan that is written for healthcare professionals.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Limitations of Use: \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. \u2022 Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose for zolmitriptan nasal spray in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to zolmitriptan nasal spray may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of zolmitriptan nasal spray in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.5 ) \u2022 Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue zolmitriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. Zolmitriptan should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Zolmitriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were: \u2022 Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatrics: unusual taste ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for zolmitriptan nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=224) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/ Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either zolmitriptan nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using zolmitriptan 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one-year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of zolmitriptan nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan nasal spray is similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [ see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving zolmitriptan compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg zolmitriptan dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there is a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After oral administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1 B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg and 5 mg in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In Study 1, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing. Pain-free response rates and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. A dose of escape medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. In Study 1, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 83% were female and 99% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 65 years). The two-hour headache response rates in patients treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray were significantly higher among patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray at all doses, compared with placebo (see Table 3). Table 3: First Attack Data: Percentage of Adult Patients with Headache Response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Study 1 PLACEBO (N=218) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=219) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=228) 31% 55%* 69%* *p < 0.001 in comparison with placebo The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response after treatment in Study 1 Note: Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (moderate or severe headache improving to mild or no pain) following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. The estimates displayed are based on a placebo controlled, outpatient trial providing evidence of efficacy. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored to 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray as compared with placebo. Four to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Estimated probability of patients taking an escape medication within the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 1 *This Kaplan-Meier plot is based on data obtained from the placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. It should be noted that the protocol did not allow remedication within 4 hours post dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; presence of headache upon awakening, relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; or presence of pre-treatment nausea. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was further supported by an interim analysis of another similarly designed trial. The 2-hour headache response rates for the first 210 subjects in that study for zolmitriptan 5 mg and placebo were 70% and 47%, respectively (N=108 and 102, respectively, p=0.0006). 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in pediatrics patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind run-in period. Patients had to have an established diagnosis of migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura with a typical untreated migraine headache attack lasting 3 hours or more. The study included treatment of a single migraine headache attack with 1 dose of single-blind placebo during the 30-day run-in period. If the patient met all conditions for randomization, including a lack of response to the placebo run-in, a subsequent single migraine headache attack was treated with 1 blinded dose of either zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg, 2.5 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 2, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 62% were female and 93% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 14 years (range 12 to 17 years). Study 2 evaluated the proportion of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who had no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment. Headache response (defined as a reduction in migraine-related headache pain severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) and the absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours post treatment were also assessed. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment was significantly higher for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg than placebo. Table 4: Percentage of Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age with No Headache Pain, With Headache Response, No Nausea, No Photophobia, and No Phonophobia Two Hours after Treatment in Study 2 Two Hours Following Treatment Placebo (N=253) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=229) No Headache Pain 17% 25% 30%* With Headache Response 39% 53%* 51%* No Photophobia 44% 66%* 56%* No Phonophobia 48% 61%* 58%* No Nausea 66% 70% 72% *p < 0.05 in comparison with placebo Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use their usual medication for pain relief. The estimated probability of patients taking escape medication during the first 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 3.

      "Instructions for Use Zolmitriptan (zohl-mi-TRIP-tan) Nasal Spray Important: For use in your nose only. Do not spray in your eyes. Note: There is only 1 dose in the nasal sprayer. Do not try to prime the nasal sprayer or you will lose the dose. Do not press the plunger until you have put the tip into your nostril or you will lose the dose. Steps for using Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray Step 1. Remove the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray unit from the box it comes in. Do not remove the unit from the plastic pack until you are ready to use it. The unit contains only 1 spray. Step 2. Blow your nose gently to clear your nasal passages before use. Step 3. Peel back the tab to remove the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray unit from the plastic pack (See Figure A). Step 4. Keeping your head in an upright position, gently close 1 nostril with your index finger and breathe out gently through your mouth. (See Figure B). Either nostril can be used. Step 5. With your other hand, hold the container with your thumb supporting the container at the bottom, and your index and middle fingers on each side of the nozzle. (See Figure C). Insert the tip of the sprayer device into your open nostril as far as feels comfortable and tilt your head slightly (See Figure D). Do not press the plunger yet. Step 6. Breathe in gently through your nose and at the same time press the plunger firmly with your thumb to release your dose of Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray ( See Figure D ). The plunger may feel stiff and you may hear a click. Keep your head slightly tilted back and remove the tip from your nose. Breathe gently through your mouth for 5 to 10 seconds. You may feel liquid in your nose or the back of your throat. This is normal. Step 7. Dispose the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray device after completing the full dose or as soon as it becomes outdated or no longer needed. Dispose of properly. Keep out of reach of children. Do not reuse. This Patient Information and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24\u00ad-hour period (2.1) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3 , 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials * * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5-HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

Because the 5-HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2. Table 2: Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Studies 1 through 5 * Study 1 was the only study in which patients treated the headache in a clinic setting. \u2020 n=number of patients randomized \u2021 NA = not applicable \u00a7 P<0.05 in comparison with placebo. \u00b6 P<0.05 in comparison with 1 mg. # Study 4 was the only study where patients were excluded who had previously used sumatriptan.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. fig1 Figure 2"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets, USP (zole\" mi trip' tan) Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take them. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan tablets.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets are serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24\u00adhour period ( 2.1 ) Do not break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets ( 2.2 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4 ) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4 ) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-313-4623 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5\u00ad-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablets. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65\u201376 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N\u00ad-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 4 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablets was demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 6) that was similar in design to the trials of zolmitriptan tablets. Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Of the 471 patients treated in Study 6, 87% were female and 97% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 - 62). At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets 2.5 mg with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%). The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 2 Hours in Study 6* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot patients taking additional treatment or not achieving headache response prior to 2 hours were censored at 2 hours. For patients with migraine-associated photophobia, phonophobia and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets as compared to placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 6 is summarized in Figure 4. Figure 4: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Study 6* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not taking additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. Taking another dose of study medication was allowed 2 hours post-dose in Study 6. In contrast to studies of zolmitriptan tablets (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), Study 6 allowed re-dosing of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets prior to 4 hours. fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use: Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets , particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials* * Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan tablets : In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets: The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablets dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan tablets commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablets. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablets administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablets dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 - 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablets and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablets administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

No increase in tumors was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC approximately 700 times that in humans at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Zolmitriptan was positive in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Zolmitriptan was negative in an in vitro mammalian gene cell mutation (CHO/HGPRT) assay and in oral in vivo mouse micronucleus assays in mouse and rat. Impairment of Fertility Studies of male and female rats administered zolmitriptan prior to and during mating and up to implantation showed no impairment of fertility at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The plasma exposure (AUC) at this dose was approximately 3000 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. figure1 figure2"

Instruct patients to seek medical advice if they have symptoms of other vasospastic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.5) ] . Medication Overuse Headache Inform patients that use of drugs to treat acute migraines for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headache, and encourage patients to record headache frequency and drug use (e.g., by keeping a headache diary) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of zolmitriptan tablets or other triptans, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Lactation Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )]. Patient Information Zolmitriptan (zole\u2019\u2019 mi trip\u2019 tan) Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan(AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET \u00ae ); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae ,WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use : Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24 hour period (2.1) Do not break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets (2.2) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3, 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablet is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablet is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablet in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptanif occurs (5.7, 7.4) Patients with Phenylketonuria : Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Arrthymias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and >placebo) were neck/throat/ jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and >placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Z olmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Z olmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, zolmitriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether zolmitriptan is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from zolmitriptan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged >65 years) compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablet dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether zolmitriptan is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from zolmitriptan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged >65 years) compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain zolmitriptan, which is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT 1B/1D ) receptor agonist. Zolmitriptan is chemically designated as (S)-4-[[3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-5-yl]methyl]-2-oxazolidinone and has the following chemical structure: The empirical formula is C 16 H 21 N 3 O 2 , representing a molecular weight of 287.36. Zolmitriptan is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in N,N-dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and practically insoluble in water. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are available as 2.5 mg and 5 mg white to off-white uncoated tablets. The orally disintegrating tablets contain mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, aspartame [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ], sodium stearyl fumarate, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, orange flavor, modified food starch and triacetin."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly nonmigraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [ see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), and Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablet was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 1.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablets was demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 6) that was similar in design to the trials of zolmitriptan tablets. Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Of the 471 patients treated in Study 6, 87% were female and 97% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 62). At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets 2.5 mg with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%). The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is depicted in Figure 3.

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan (ZOLE-mi-TRIP-tan) Orally Disintegrating Tablets Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What is zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan is not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan work? Treatment with zolmitriptan reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan. Who should not take zolmitriptan? Do not take zolmitriptan if you: \u2022Have heart disease or a history of heart disease \u2022Have uncontrolled high blood pressure \u2022Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) \u2022Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation \u2022Have serious liver problems \u2022Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT\u00ae), eletriptan (RELPAX\u00ae), frovatriptan (FROVA\u00ae), naratriptan (AMERGE\u00ae), rizatriptan (MAXALT\u00ae), sumatriptan (IMITREX\u00ae), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S\u00ae, CAFERGOT\u00ae, ERGOMAR\u00ae, WIGRAINE\u00ae; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45\u00ae or MIGRANAL\u00ae; or methysergide (SANSERT\u00ae). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan. \u2022Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL\u00ae) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE\u00ae) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. \u2022Are allergic to zolmitriptan or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are sensitive to phenylalanine, which can be found in the artificial sweetener aspartame. Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains phenylalanine. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA\u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO\u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL\u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC\u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX\u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT\u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM\u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX\u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA\u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR\u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breast feeding, planning to breast feed, or not using effective birth control. How should I take zolmitriptan? \u2022Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. \u2022If you take zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets, do not remove the tablet from the blister pack until you are ready to take your medicine. \u2022You do not need to take any liquids with your zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets. \u2022Take zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets whole. \u2022Place zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets on your tongue, where it will dissolve. \u2022Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. \u2022If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose anytime after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined in any 24 hour period). If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan are: \u2022Pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw \u2022dizziness \u2022tingling or other abnormal sensations \u2022tiredness \u2022drowsiness \u2022feeling warm or cold \u2022nausea \u2022feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body \u2022dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan: \u2022 severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw \u2022shortness of breath or wheezing \u2022sudden or severe stomach pain \u2022hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling \u2022problems seeing \u2022unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan. If you would like more information about zolmitriptan, talk to your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information on zolmitriptan that is written for healthcare professionals.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avema Pharma Solutions at 1-877-753-3935 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials 1 Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan Tablets 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan Tablets 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan Tablets 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest-pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw-pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other-pressure/tightness/heaviness 0 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% 1 Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, zolmitriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether zolmitriptan is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from zolmitriptan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment: After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with acute overdose of zolmitriptan. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. figure 1 figure 2"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How do zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)* or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)*, two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA\u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO\u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL\u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC\u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX\u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT\u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM\u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX\u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA\u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR\u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breast-feeding, planning to breast-feed, or not using effective birth control. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how many zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take them. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose anytime after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets : severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan tablets. If you would like more information about zolmitriptan tablets, talk to your doctor.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use: Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicate for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period (2.1) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3, 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4)] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g.,ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan . As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Arrthymias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and >plcebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials 1 Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other- Pressure/tightness/heaviness 0% 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% 1 Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There was no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There was insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248 280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC\u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet, with a median T max of 3 hours for orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLCr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4)] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet, with a median T max of 3 hours for orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLCr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.4)] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 4 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraines over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot,patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. zolmitriptan-fig1.jpg zolmitriptan-fig2.jpg"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What is zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan is not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan work? Treatment with zolmitriptan reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan. Who should not take zolmitriptan? Do not take zolmitriptan if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \"triptans\" like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan. How should I take zolmitriptan? Take zolmitriptan exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined)in any 24-hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan? Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan. If you would like more information about zolmitriptan, talk to your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information on zolmitriptan that is written for healthcare professionals. You can also call 1-866-210-9797. What are the Ingredients in zolmitriptan?

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Limitations of Use: \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache. \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. \u2022 Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) \u2022 Not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose for zolmitriptan nasal spray in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to zolmitriptan nasal spray may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of zolmitriptan nasal spray in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.5 ) \u2022 Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue zolmitriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. Zolmitriptan should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Zolmitriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were: \u2022 Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatrics: unusual taste ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for zolmitriptan nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=224) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either zolmitriptan nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using zolmitriptan 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one-year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of zolmitriptan nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan nasal spray is similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [ see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving zolmitriptan compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg zolmitriptan dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

( 2.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a placebo-controlled study with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 229 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. In an earlier study with a different design, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was evaluated in the acute treatment of migraine headache in 171 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. In that study, the efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray was not established. The safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two placebo-controlled studies with a total of 81 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 431 pediatric patients receiving zolmitriptan 5 mg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. The safety profile of zolmitriptan nasal spray in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is similar to the profile observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there is a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events; those that were reported are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving zolmitriptan [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After oral administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with zolmitriptan should continue for at least 15 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled. A dosage adjustment is therefore required [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg and 5 mg in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In Study 1, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing. Pain-free response rates and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. A dose of escape medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. In Study 1, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 83% were female and 99% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 41 years (range 18 to 65 years). The two-hour headache response rates in patients treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray were significantly higher among patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray at all doses, compared with placebo (see Table 3). Table 3: First Attack Data: Percentage of Adult Patients with Headache Response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment in Study 1 PLACEBO (N=218) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=219) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=228) 31% 55%* 69%* *p < 0.001 in comparison with placebo The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response after treatment in Study 1 Note: Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (moderate or severe headache improving to mild or no pain) following treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. The estimates displayed are based on a placebo controlled, outpatient trial providing evidence of efficacy. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored to 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray as compared with placebo. Four to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Estimated probability of patients taking an escape medication within the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment in Study 1 *This Kaplan-Meier plot is based on data obtained from the placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. It should be noted that the protocol did not allow remedication within 4 hours post dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; presence of headache upon awakening, relationship to menses; gender, age or weight of the patient; or presence of pre-treatment nausea. The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was further supported by an interim analysis of another similarly designed trial. The 2-hour headache response rates for the first 210 subjects in that study for zolmitriptan 5 mg and placebo were 70% and 47%, respectively (N=108 and 102, respectively, p=0.0006). 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine headache with or without aura in pediatrics patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a single-blind run-in period. Patients had to have an established diagnosis of migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura with a typical untreated migraine headache attack lasting 3 hours or more. The study included treatment of a single migraine headache attack with 1 dose of single-blind placebo during the 30-day run-in period. If the patient met all conditions for randomization, including a lack of response to the placebo run-in, a subsequent single migraine headache attack was treated with 1 blinded dose of either zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg, 2.5 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 2, of the patients taking zolmitriptan nasal spray 2.5 mg or 5 mg, 62% were female and 93% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 14 years (range 12 to 17 years). Study 2 evaluated the proportion of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who had no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment. Headache response (defined as a reduction in migraine-related headache pain severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) and the absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours post treatment were also assessed. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with no headache pain at 2 hours following treatment was significantly higher for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg than placebo. Table 4: Percentage of Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age with No Headache Pain, With Headache Response, No Nausea, No Photophobia, and No Phonophobia Two Hours after Treatment in Study 2 Two Hours Following Treatment Placebo (N=253) Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N=81) Zolmitriptan 5 mg (N=229) No Headache Pain 17% 25% 30%* With Headache Response 39% 53%* 51%* No Photophobia 44% 66%* 56%* No Phonophobia 48% 61%* 58%* No Nausea 66% 70% 72% *p < 0.05 in comparison with placebo Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use their usual medication for pain relief. The estimated probability of patients taking escape medication during the first 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 3.

Keeping your head in an upright position, gently close 1 nostril with your index finger and breathe out gently through your mouth. (See Figure B). Either nostril can be used. Step 5. With your other hand, hold the container with your thumb supporting the container at the bottom, and your index and middle fingers on each side of the nozzle. (See Figure C). Insert the tip of the sprayer device into your open nostril as far as feels comfortable and tilt your head slightly (See Figure D). Do not press the plunger yet. Step 6. Breathe in gently through your nose and at the same time press the plunger firmly with your thumb to release your dose of Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray ( See Figure D ). The plunger may feel stiff and you may hear a click. Keep your head slightly tilted back and remove the tip from your nose. Breathe gently through your mouth for 5 to 10 seconds. You may feel liquid in your nose or the back of your throat. This is normal. Step 7. Dispose the Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray device after completing the full dose or as soon as it becomes outdated or no longer needed. Dispose of properly. Keep out of reach of children. Do not reuse.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use \u2022 Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. \u2022 Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. \u2022 Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : \u2022 Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine ( 1 ) \u2022 Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose: 5 mg ( 2.1 ) \u2022 May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure : Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache : Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome : Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs ( 5.7 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) . There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. \u2022 Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. \u2022 Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. \u2022 Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. \u2022 Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. \u2022 Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. \u2022 Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1(888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials 1 Placebo (n=401) Zolmitriptan Tablets 1 mg (n=163) Zolmitriptan Tablets 2.5 mg (n=498) Zolmitriptan Tablets 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Warm/cold sensation 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest-pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw-pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Other-pressure/tightness/heaviness 0 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% 1 Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.3 5-HT 1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Cl cr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Cl cr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.4 ) ]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 4 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1 Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response (Reduction in Headache Severity from Moderate or Severe Pain to Mild or No Headache) Within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* * In this Kaplan-Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 The Estimated Probability Of Patients Taking A Second Dose Or Other Medication For Migraines Over The 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose Of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5* *In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not using additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs. figure 1 Figure 2 The Estimated Probability Of Patients Taking A Second Dose Or Other Medication For Migraines Over The 24 Hours Following The Initial Dose Of Study Treatment in Pooled Studies 2, 3, and 5"

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan (ZOLE-mi-TRIP-tan) Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How do zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: \u2022 Have heart disease or a history of heart disease \u2022 Have uncontrolled high blood pressure \u2022 Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) \u2022 Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation \u2022 Have serious liver problems \u2022 Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. \u2022 Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. \u2022 Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? \u2022 Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how many zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take them. \u2022 Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. \u2022 If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: \u2022 pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw \u2022 dizziness \u2022 tingling or other abnormal sensations \u2022 tiredness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 feeling warm or cold \u2022 nausea \u2022 feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body \u2022 dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Zolmitriptan tablets are a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (1) Limitations of Use : Use only after a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established (1) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine (1) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache (1)"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg (2.1) Maximum single dose: 5 mg (2.1) May repeat dose after 2 hours if needed; not to exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period (2.1) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: 1.25 mg recommended (2.3 , 8.6) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tabletsin patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets are co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if occurs (5.7 , 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ] . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT 1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT 1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets doses [see Contraindications (4) ] . Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] .",

Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Av\u00e9ma Pharma Solutions at 1-877-753-3935 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1,200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1,100, and 5,000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1,100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] .

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2% to 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1,200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1,100, and 5,000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1,100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan tablets commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] ; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and C max of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the T max is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median T max of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablet. The AUC, C max , and T max for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC 0-4 and C max for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean T max was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablet administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , Tmax , and AUC 0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablet dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan tablet dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablets and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan tablet-treated patients [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.4) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablet administration delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Zolmitriptan Tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs.

      "Patient Information Zolmitriptan Tablets (zole\u2019-mi-trip-tan) Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets ? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How do zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets block the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets ? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have or had a stroke or problems with your blood circulation Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ), eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ), frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ), naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ), rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae ), sumatriptan (IMITREX \u00ae ), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S \u00ae , CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , WIGRAINE \u00ae ; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45 \u00ae or MIGRANAL \u00ae ; or methysergide (SANSERT \u00ae ). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL \u00ae ) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE \u00ae ) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA \u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO \u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL \u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC \u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX \u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT \u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM \u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX \u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA \u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR \u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets ? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how many zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take them. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray) combined in any 24-hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets ? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold \u00b7nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets : severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan tablets.

      "Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use: Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "contraindications": [
      "Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Ischemic coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), other significant underlying cardiovascular disease, or coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal\u2019s angina [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] . Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] . History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] . Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] . Ischemic bowel disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] . Uncontrolled hypertension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)] . Recent use (i.e., within 24 hours) of another 5-HT1 agonist, ergotamine-containing medication, or ergot-type medication (such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1, 7.3)] .

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets doses [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets , particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]."

In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets: The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets"

      "7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan tablets dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12)]."

There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and Cmax of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the Tmax is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median Tmax of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablets. The AUC, Cmax, and Tmax for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC0-4 and Cmax for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean Tmax was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablets administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablets dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 - 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablets and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both Cmax and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2, 7.4)]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). Cmax and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablets administration delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and Tmax was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "Zolmitriptan tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Patient Information Zolmitriptan (zole\u2019\u2019 mi trip\u2019 tan) Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT\u00ae), eletriptan (RELPAX\u00ae), frovatriptan (FROVA\u00ae), naratriptan(AMERGE\u00ae), rizatriptan (MAXALT\u00ae), sumatriptan (IMITREX\u00ae), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET\u00ae); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S\u00ae, CAFERGOT\u00ae, ERGOMAR\u00ae,WIGRAINE\u00ae; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45\u00ae or MIGRANAL\u00ae; or methysergide (SANSERT\u00ae). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL\u00ae) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE\u00ae) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA\u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO\u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL\u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC\u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX\u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT\u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM\u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX\u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA\u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR\u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines. Tell your doctor if you know that you have any of the following: risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity (overweight), menopause, or a family history of heart disease or stroke. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if zolmitriptan tablets will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed. It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. You can also contact FDA to report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan tablets.

      "Zolmitriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use: Only use zolmitriptan tablets if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan tablets treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zolmitriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Dosing Information The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg. In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day. 2.4 Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine If zolmitriptan tablets is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na\u00efve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets doses [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets , particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]."

Increase in Blood Pressure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets: The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets."

      "7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan tablets in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) \u2248280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u22481, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs \u224870, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC \u2248280 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for zolmitriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan tablets were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of zolmitriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment After oral zolmitriptan tablets administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].

    "overdosage": [
      "There is no experience with acute overdose of zolmitriptan tablets. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan tablets commonly experienced sedation. There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan tablets. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan tablets is 3 hours [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan tablets for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan tablets for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg. The AUC and Cmax of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the Tmax is somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median Tmax of 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the zolmitriptan tablets. The AUC, Cmax, and Tmax for the active N-desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations. During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC0-4 and Cmax for zolmitriptan, dosed as a zolmitriptan tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean Tmax was delayed by one-half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing. Distribution Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan tablets administration. Excretion Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0-\u221e of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan tablets dose. Adjust the zolmitriptan dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)]. Renal Impairment Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Age Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 - 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 39 years). Sex Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences. Hypertensive Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interaction Studies All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan tablets and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. MAO Inhibitors Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both Cmax and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in zolmitriptan-treated patients [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2, 7.4)]. Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Cimetidine Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. Fluoxetine The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). Propranolol Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). Cmax and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan tablets. Acetaminophen A single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan tablets administration delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and Tmax was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan tablets on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Zolmitriptan was administered to mice and rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Mice were dosed for 85 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females); rats were dosed for 101 weeks (males) and 86 weeks (females). There was no evidence of drug-induced tumors in mice at plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 700 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. In rats, there was an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in male rats receiving 400 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC approximately 700 times that in humans at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Zolmitriptan was positive in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Zolmitriptan was negative in an in vitro mammalian gene cell mutation (CHO/HGPRT) assay and in oral in vivo mouse micronucleus assays in mouse and rat. Impairment of Fertility Studies of male and female rats administered zolmitriptan prior to and during mating and up to implantation showed no impairment of fertility at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The plasma exposure (AUC) at this dose was approximately 3000 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "Zolmitriptan tablets The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied. Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan tablets was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack. In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study. The results of these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 2.

Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours. For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of zolmitriptan tablets as compared with placebo. Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. The studies did not allow taking additional doses of study medication within 2 hours post-dose. The efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs."

Patient Information Zolmitriptan (zole\u2019\u2019 mi trip\u2019 tan) Tablets, USP Please read this information before you start taking zolmitriptan tablets and each time you renew your prescription just in case anything has changed. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss zolmitriptan tablets when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. What are zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are a prescription medication used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Zolmitriptan tablets are not for other types of headaches. The safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan tablets in patients under 18 have not been established. What is a Migraine Headache? Migraine is an intense, throbbing headache. You may have pain on one or both sides of your head. You may have nausea and vomiting, and be sensitive to light and noise. The pain and symptoms of a migraine headache can be worse than a common headache. Some women get migraines around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura. How does zolmitriptan tablets work? Treatment with zolmitriptan tablets reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the headache pain of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan tablets blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by zolmitriptan tablets. Who should not take zolmitriptan tablets? Do not take zolmitriptan tablets if you: Have heart disease or a history of heart disease Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have hemiplegic or basilar migraine (if you are not sure about this, ask your doctor) Have serious liver problems Have taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: other \u201ctriptans\u201d like almotriptan (AXERT\u00ae), eletriptan (RELPAX\u00ae), frovatriptan (FROVA\u00ae), naratriptan(AMERGE\u00ae), rizatriptan (MAXALT\u00ae), sumatriptan (IMITREX\u00ae), sumatriptan/naproxen (TREXIMET\u00ae); ergotamines like BELLERGAL-S\u00ae, CAFERGOT\u00ae, ERGOMAR\u00ae,WIGRAINE\u00ae; dihydroergotamine like D.H.E. 45\u00ae or MIGRANAL\u00ae; or methysergide (SANSERT\u00ae). These medications have side effects similar to zolmitriptan tablets. Have taken monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (NARDIL\u00ae) or tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE\u00ae) for depression or other conditions within the last 2 weeks. Are allergic to zolmitriptan tablets or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is zolmitriptan. The inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this leaflet. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, and herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two types of drugs for depression or other disorders. Common SSRIs are CELEXA\u00ae (citalopram HBr), LEXAPRO\u00ae (escitalopram oxalate), PAXIL\u00ae (paroxetine), PROZAC\u00ae (fluoxetine), SYMBYAX\u00ae (olanzapine/fluoxetine), ZOLOFT\u00ae (sertraline), SARAFEM\u00ae (fluoxetine) and LUVOX\u00ae (fluvoxamine). Common SNRIs are CYMBALTA\u00ae (duloxetine) and EFFEXOR\u00ae (venlafaxine). Your doctor will decide if you can take zolmitriptan tablets with your other medicines.

It is not known if zolmitriptan passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby while using zolmitriptan tablets. How should I take zolmitriptan tablets? Take zolmitriptan tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much zolmitriptan tablets to take and when to take it. Safely throw away any unused tablets or pieces of tablets that have been removed from the blister packaging. If your headache comes back after your first dose, you may take a second dose any time after 2 hours of taking the first dose. For any attack where the first dose did not work, do not take a second dose without talking with your doctor. Do not take more than a total of 10 mg of zolmitriptan (tablets or spray combined) in any 24 hour period. If you take too much medicine, contact your doctor, hospital emergency department, or poison control center right away. What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan tablets? Zolmitriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are: pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw dizziness tingling or other abnormal sensations tiredness drowsiness feeling warm or cold nausea feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body dry mouth In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets: severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw shortness of breath or wheezing sudden or severe stomach pain hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling problems seeing unusual weakness or numbness Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets. This is not a complete list of side effects. Talk to your doctor if you develop any symptoms that concern you. You can also contact FDA to report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch What to do in case of an overdose? Call your doctor or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. General advice about zolmitriptan tablets Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use zolmitriptan tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give zolmitriptan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. People may be harmed if they take medicines that have not been prescribed for them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about zolmitriptan tablets.
