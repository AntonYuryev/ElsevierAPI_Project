    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Obtain a negative pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with mifepristone tablets or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days ( 2.1 ). Administer once daily orally with a meal ( 2.2 ). The recommended starting dose is 300 mg once daily ( 2.2 ). Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased in 300 mg increments to a maximum of 1,200 mg once daily. Do not exceed 20 mg/kg per day ( 2.2 ). Renal impairment: do not exceed 600 mg once daily ( 2.3 ). Mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment: do not exceed 600 mg once daily. Do not use in severe hepatic impairment ( 2.4 ). Concomitant administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors: Do not exceed 900 mg once daily ( 2.5 ). 2.1 Testing Prior to and During Mifepristone Administration Obtain a negative pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with mifepristone tablets or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dose is 300 mg orally once daily. Mifepristone tablets must be given as a single daily dose. Mifepristone tablets should always be taken with a meal. Patients should swallow the tablet whole. Do not split, crush, or chew tablets. Dosing and titration The daily dose of mifepristone tablets may be increased in 300 mg increments. The dose of mifepristone tablets may be increased to a maximum of 1,200 mg once daily but should not exceed 20 mg/kg per day. Increases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 2 to 4 weeks. Decisions about dose increases should be based on a clinical assessment of tolerability and degree of improvement in Cushing\u2019s syndrome manifestations. Changes in glucose control, anti-diabetic medication requirements, insulin levels, and psychiatric symptoms may provide an early assessment of response (within 6 weeks) and may help guide early dose titration. Improvements in cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae, and body weight occur over a longer period of time and, along with measures of glucose control, may be used to determine dose changes beyond the first 2 months of therapy. Careful and gradual titration of mifepristone tablets accompanied by monitoring for recognized adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.2 )] may reduce the risk of severe adverse reactions. Dose reduction or even dose discontinuation may be needed in some clinical situations. If mifepristone tablets treatment is interrupted, it should be reinitiated at the lowest dose (300 mg). If treatment was interrupted because of adverse reactions, the titration should aim for a dose lower than the one that resulted in treatment interruption. 2.3 Dosing in Renal Impairment No change in initial dose of mifepristone tablets is required in renal impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg [see Renal Impairment ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosing in Hepatic Impairment No change in the initial dose of mifepristone tablets is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. Mifepristone tablets should not be used in severe hepatic impairment [see Hepatic Impairment ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Concomitant Administration with CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole may increase exposure to mifepristone. Mifepristone tablets should be used in combination with strong CYP3A inhibitors only when necessary [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Administration of mifepristone tablets to patients already being treated with strong CYP3A inhibitors: Start at a dose of 300 mg. If clinically indicated, titrate to a maximum of 900 mg. Administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors to patients already being treated with mifepristone tablets: Adjust the dose of mifepristone tablets according to Table 1. Table 1. Dose adjustment of mifepristone tablets when strong CYP3A inhibitor is added Current dose of mifepristone tablets Adjustment to dose of mifepristone tablets if adding a strong CYP3A inhibitor 300 mg No change 600 mg Reduce dose to 300 mg. If clinically indicated, titrate to a maximum of 600 mg. 900 mg Reduce dose to 600 mg. If clinically indicated, titrate to a maximum of 900 mg. 1,200 mg Reduce dose to 900 mg."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Adrenal insufficiency : Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency ( 5.1 ). Hypokalemia : Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to treatment and monitored for during treatment ( 5.2 ). Vaginal bleeding and endometrial changes : Women may experience endometrial thickening or unexpected vaginal bleeding. Use with caution if patient also has a hemorrhagic disorder or is on anti-coagulant therapy ( 5.3 ). QT interval prolongation : Avoid use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, or in patients with potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval ( 5.4 ). Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Concomitant use can increase mifepristone plasma levels. Use only when necessary and limit mifepristone dose to 900 mg ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Adrenal Insufficiency Patients receiving mifepristone may experience adrenal insufficiency. Because serum cortisol levels remain elevated and may even increase during treatment with mifepristone, serum cortisol levels do not provide an accurate assessment of hypoadrenalism in patients receiving mifepristone. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including weakness, nausea, increased fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, discontinue treatment with mifepristone immediately and administer glucocorticoids without delay. High doses of supplemental glucocorticoids may be needed to overcome the glucocorticoid receptor blockade produced by mifepristone. Factors considered in deciding on the duration of glucocorticoid treatment should include the long half-life of mifepristone (85 hours). Treatment with mifepristone at a lower dose can be resumed after resolution of adrenal insufficiency. Patients should also be evaluated for precipitating causes of hypoadrenalism (infection, trauma, etc.). 5.2 Hypokalemia In a study of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with mifepristone. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating mifepristone. During mifepristone administration, serum potassium should be measured 1 to 2 weeks after starting or increasing the dose of mifepristone and periodically thereafter. Hypokalemia can occur at any time during mifepristone treatment. Mifepristone-induced hypokalemia should be treated with intravenous or oral potassium supplementation based on event severity. If hypokalemia persists in spite of potassium supplementation, consider adding mineralocorticoid antagonists. 5.3 Vaginal Bleeding and Endometrial Changes Being an antagonist of the progesterone receptor, mifepristone promotes unopposed endometrial proliferation that may result in endometrium thickening, cystic dilatation of endometrial glands, and vaginal bleeding. Mifepristone should be used with caution in women who have hemorrhagic disorders or are receiving concurrent anticoagulant therapy. Women who experience vaginal bleeding during mifepristone treatment should be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation. 5.4 QT Interval Prolongation Mifepristone and its metabolites block IKr. Mifepristone prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. There is little or no experience with high exposure, concomitant dosing with other QT- prolonging drugs, or potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval [see Warnings & Precautions ( 5.6 )] . To minimize risk, the lowest effective dose should always be used. 5.5 Exacerbation/Deterioration of Conditions Treated with Corticosteroids Use of mifepristone in patients who receive corticosteroids for other conditions (e.g., autoimmune disorders) may lead to exacerbation or deterioration of such conditions, as mifepristone antagonizes the desired effects of glucocorticoid in these clinical settings. For medical conditions in which chronic corticosteroid therapy is lifesaving (e.g., immunosuppression in organ transplantation), mifepristone is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . 5.6 Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Mifepristone should be used with caution in patients taking ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole, as these could increase the concentration of mifepristone in the blood. The benefit of concomitant use of these agents should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. Mifepristone should be used in combination with strong CYP3A inhibitors only when necessary, and in such cases the dose should be limited to 900 mg per day [see Warnings & Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.7 Pneumocystis jiroveci Infection Patients with endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome are at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia during mifepristone treatment. Patients may present with respiratory distress shortly after initiation of mifepristone. Appropriate diagnostic tests should be undertaken and treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci should be considered. 5.8 Potential Effects of Hypercortisolemia Mifepristone does not reduce serum cortisol levels. Elevated cortisol levels may activate mineralocorticoid receptors which are also expressed in cardiac tissues. Caution should be used in patients with underlying heart conditions including heart failure and coronary vascular disease. 5.9 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in Cushing\u2019s syndrome (\u226520%): nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood potassium, arthralgia, vomiting, peripheral edema, hypertension, dizziness, decreased appetite, endometrial hypertrophy ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Safety data on the use of mifepristone are available from 50 patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome enrolled in an uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center trial (Study 400). Forty-three patients had Cushing\u2019s disease and all except one had previously undergone pituitary surgery. Four patients had ectopic ACTH secretion, and three had adrenal carcinoma. Patients were treated for up to 24 weeks. A dose of 300 mg per day was administered for the initial 14 days; thereafter, the dose could be escalated in increments of 300 mg per day based on assessments of tolerability and clinical response. Doses were escalated up to 900 mg per day for patients <60 kg, or 1,200 mg per day for patients >60 kg. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (reported in \u226520% of patients, regardless of relationship to mifepristone) were nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood potassium, arthralgia, vomiting, peripheral edema, hypertension, dizziness, decreased appetite, and endometrial hypertrophy. Drug-related adverse events resulted in dose interruption or reduction in study drug in 40% of patients. The adverse reactions that occurred in \u226510% of the Cushing\u2019s syndrome patients receiving mifepristone, regardless of relationship to mifepristone, are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

In study subjects that experienced declines in HDL-C, levels returned to baseline following discontinuation of drug. The clinical significance of the treatment-related reduction in HDL-C levels in patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome is not known. In a study of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with mifepristone. In these cases, hypokalemia responded to treatment with potassium supplementation and/or mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy (e.g., spironolactone or eplerenone). Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating mifepristone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were seen in subjects treated with mifepristone. Of the 42 subjects with detectable TSH at baseline, eight (19%) had increases in TSH above the normal range, while remaining asymptomatic. The TSH levels returned to normal in most patients without intervention when mifepristone was discontinued at the end of the study. Vaginal Bleeding and Endometrial Changes In Study 400, the thickness of the endometrium increased from a mean of 6.14 mm at baseline (n=23) to 15.7 mm at end-of-trial (n=18) in premenopausal women; in postmenopausal women the increase was from 2.75 mm (n=6) to 7.35 mm (n=8). Endometrial thickness above the upper limit of normal was reported in 10/26 females who had baseline and end-of-trial transvaginal ultrasound (38%). The endometrial thickness returned to the normal range in 3 out of 10 patients 6 weeks after treatment cessation at the end of the study. Vaginal bleeding occurred in 5 out of 35 females (14%). Two of five subjects with vaginal bleeding had normal endometrial thickness. Endometrial biopsies were performed in six patients; five of these patients had endometrial thickening. No endometrial carcinoma was detected in the sampled cases. Additional Data from Clinical Trials The following are adverse events that were reported in Study 400 at frequencies of \u22655% to 10%, and may be related to mifepristone\u2019s mechanism of action: Gastrointestinal disorders: gastroesophageal reflux, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, malaise, edema, pitting edema, thirst Investigations: blood triglycerides increased Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscular weakness, flank pain, musculoskeletal chest pain Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive system and breast disorders: vaginal hemorrhage, metrorrhagia [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Adrenal Insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency was reported in two subjects (4%) in Study 400. The most typical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were nausea and decreased appetite. No hypotension or hypoglycemia was reported during the events. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in both cases with mifepristone interruption and/or dexamethasone administration. Rash Generalized, maculopapular rash was reported in 2 subjects (4%) in Study 400. Two additional subjects developed pruritus (4%). None resulted in discontinuation of mifepristone, and all the events resolved by the end of the study. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post approval use of mifepristone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Angioedema"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Based on the long terminal half-life of mifepristone after reaching steady state, at least 2 weeks should elapse after cessation of mifepristone before initiating or increasing the dose of any interacting concomitant medication. Drugs metabolized by CYP3A: Administer drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A at the lowest dose when used with mifepristone ( 7.1 ). CYP3A inhibitors: Caution should be used when mifepristone is used with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Limit mifepristone dose to 900 mg per day when used with strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 7.2 ). CYP3A inducers: Do not use mifepristone with CYP3A inducers ( 7.3 ). Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8/2C9: Use the lowest dose of CYP2C8/2C9 substrates when used with mifepristone ( 7.4 ). Drugs metabolized by CYP2B6: Use of mifepristone should be done with caution with bupropion and efavirenz ( 7.5 ). Hormonal contraceptives: Do not use with mifepristone ( 7.6 ). 7.1 Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP3A, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP3A is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug. Discontinuation or dose reduction of such medications may be necessary with mifepristone coadministration. Mifepristone increased the exposure to simvastatin and simvastatin acid significantly in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of simvastatin or lovastatin is contraindicated because of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] . The exposure of other substrates of CYP3A with narrow therapeutic ranges, such as cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, may be increased by concomitant administration with mifepristone. Therefore, the concomitant use of such CYP3A substrates with mifepristone is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] . Other drugs with similar high first pass metabolism in which CYP3A is the primary route of metabolism should be used with extreme caution if coadministered with mifepristone. The lowest possible dose and/or a decreased frequency of dosing must be used with therapeutic drug monitoring when possible. Use of alternative drugs without these metabolic characteristics is advised when possible with concomitant mifepristone. If drugs that undergo low first pass metabolism by CYP3A or drugs in which CYP3A is not the major metabolic route are coadministered with mifepristone, use the lowest dose of concomitant medication necessary, with appropriate monitoring and follow-up [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 CYP3A Inhibitors Medications that inhibit CYP3A could increase plasma mifepristone concentrations and dose reduction of mifepristone may be required. Ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole may increase exposure to mifepristone. Caution should be used when strong CYP3A inhibitors are prescribed in combination with mifepristone. The benefit of concomitant use of these agents should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. The dose of mifepristone should be limited to 900 mg, and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be used only when necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings & Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP3A Inducers No medications that induce CYP3A have been studied when coadministered with mifepristone. Avoid coadministration of mifepristone and CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort. 7.4 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C8/2C9 Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2C8/2C9, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C8/2C9 is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug. Mifepristone significantly increased exposure of fluvastatin, a typical CYP2C8/2C9 substrate, in healthy subjects. When given concomitantly with mifepristone, drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8/2C9 (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and repaglinide) should be used at the smallest recommended doses, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2B6 Mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and may cause significant increases in exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2B6 such as bupropion and efavirenz. Since no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of mifepristone on substrates of CYP2B6, the concomitant use of bupropion and efavirenz should be undertaken with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.6 Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Mifepristone is a progesterone-receptor antagonist and will interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, non-hormonal contraceptive methods should be used [See Use In Specific Populations (8.3)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mifepristone is contraindicated in pregnancy because the use of mifepristone results in pregnancy loss. There are no data that assess the risk of birth defects in women exposed to mifepristone during pregnancy. Available data limited to exposure following a single dose of mifepristone during pregnancy showed a higher rate of major birth defects compared to the general population comparator (See Data) . Mifepristone administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis caused pregnancy loss in all species at clinically relevant doses based on body surface area comparisons (See Data) .The inhibition of both endogenous and exogenous progesterone by mifepristone at the progesterone receptor results in pregnancy loss. If mifepristone is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [See Contraindications ( 4 )] The estimated risk of fetal loss is elevated in patients with active Cushing\u2019s syndrome (24% to 30%), and the risk of major birth defects is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data There are no data on long term exposure to mifepristone in pregnancy. Available data are limited to exposure to a single dose of mifepristone for pregnancy termination. In a prospective study in France of 46 pregnancies exposed to a single dose of mifepristone alone and 59 pregnancies exposed to a single dose of mifepristone and misoprostol, the overall major birth defect rate (4%) was greater than the general population background rate of 2% to 3% (2 birth defects in each group). There was no pattern of birth defects identified. Animal Data Reproductive studies were performed in mice, rats and rabbits at doses of 0.25 to 4.0 mg/kg (less than human exposure at the maximum clinical dose, based on body surface area). Because of the anti-progestational activity of mifepristone, fetal losses were much higher than in control animals. Skull deformities were detected in rabbit studies at less than human exposure, although mifepristone did not cause any adverse developmental effects in rats or mice during organogenesis. These deformities were most likely due to the mechanical effects of uterine contractions resulting from antagonism of the progesterone receptor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mifepristone is present in human milk, however, there are no data on the amount of mifepristone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production during long term use of mifepristone (see Data) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mifepristone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mifepristone or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant, women who discontinue or interrupt mifepristone treatment may consider pumping and discarding milk during treatment and for 18 to 21 days (5 to 6 half-lives) after the last dose, before breastfeeding. Data Available published data based on intake of a single dose of 600 mg of mifepristone in 10 breastfeeding women who were 6 to 12 months postpartum showed a small amount in breast milk (the estimated relative infant dose was 0.5%). The half-life of mifepristone is longer with repeat dosing compared to a single dose; therefore, there may be greater exposure with long term use. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Due to its anti-progestational activity, mifepristone causes pregnancy loss. Perform pregnancy testing before the initiation of treatment with mifepristone or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days in females of reproductive potential. Contraception Recommend non-hormonal contraception for the duration of treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Mifepristone interferes with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. [See Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mifepristone in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with mifepristone did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger people. 8.6 Renal Impairment The maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day in renally impaired patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied, and mifepristone should not be used in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Mifepristone is a cortisol receptor blocker for oral administration. The chemical name of mifepristone is 11\u03b2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-17\u03b2-hydroxy-17\u03b1-(1-propynyl)-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one. The molecular formula is C 29 H 35 NO 2 ; the molecular weight is 429.60, and the structural formula is: Mifepristone demonstrates a pH-related solubility profile. The greatest solubility is achieved in acidic media (~ 25 mg/mL at pH 1.5) and solubility declines rapidly as the pH is increased. At pH values above 2.5 the solubility of mifepristone is less than 1 mg/mL. Each mifepristone tablet for oral use contains 300 mg of mifepristone. The inactive ingredients of mifepristone tablets are FD&C Blue #1 Brilliant Blue FCF Aluminum Lake, FD&C Yellow #5 (tartrazine) Aluminum Lake, FD&C Yellow #6 Sunset Yellow FCF Aluminum Lake, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate type A, titanium dioxide, and triacetin. 1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mifepristone is a selective antagonist of the progesterone receptor at low doses and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) at higher doses. Mifepristone has high affinity for the GR-II receptor but little affinity for the GR-I (MR, mineralocorticoid) receptor. In addition, mifepristone appears to have little or no affinity for estrogen, muscarinic, histaminic, or monoamine receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Because mifepristone acts at the receptor level to block the effects of cortisol, its antagonistic actions affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in such a way as to further increase circulating cortisol levels while, at the same time, blocking their effects. Mifepristone and the three active metabolites have greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor [100% (mifepristone), 61% (metabolite 1), 48% (metabolite 2), and 45% (metabolite 3)] than either dexamethasone (23%) or cortisol (9%). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, time to peak plasma concentrations of mifepristone occurred between 1 and 2 hours following single dose, and between 1 and 4 hours following multiple doses of 600 mg of mifepristone in healthy volunteers. Mean plasma concentrations of three active metabolites of mifepristone peak between 2 and 8 hours after multiple doses of 600 mg/day, and the combined concentrations of the metabolites exceed that of the parent mifepristone. Exposure to mifepristone is substantially less than dose proportional. Time to steady state is within 2 weeks, and the mean (SD) half-life of the parent mifepristone was 85 (61) hours following multiple doses of 600 mg/day of mifepristone. Studies evaluating the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of mifepristone demonstrate a significant increase in plasma levels of mifepristone when dosed with food. To achieve consistent plasma drug concentrations, patients should be instructed to always take their medication with meals. Distribution Mifepristone is highly bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and approaches saturation at doses of 100 mg (2.5 \u00b5M) or more. Mifepristone and its metabolites also bind to albumin and are distributed to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). As determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, binding of mifepristone and its three active metabolites to human plasma proteins was concentration-dependent. Binding was approximately 99.2% for mifepristone, and ranged from 96.1% to 98.9% for the three active metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) has been shown to be involved in mifepristone metabolism in human liver microsomes. Two of the known active metabolites are the product of demethylation (one monodemethylated and one di-demethylated), while a third active metabolite results from hydroxylation (monohydroxylated). Elimination and Excretion Excretion is primarily (approximately 90%) via the fecal route. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min, but not on dialysis) was evaluated following multiple doses of 1,200 mg mifepristone for 7 days. Mean exposure to mifepristone increased 31%, with similar or smaller increases in metabolite exposure as compared to subjects with normal renal function (CrCL \u226590 mL/min). There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.21 [0.71 to 2.06]; metabolite 1: 1.43 [0.84 to 2.44]; metabolite 2: 1.18 [0.64 to 2.17] and metabolite 3: 1.19 [0.71 to 1.99]). No change in the initial dose of mifepristone is needed for renal impairment; the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was evaluated in a single- and multiple-dose study (600 mg for 7 days). The pharmacokinetics in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal hepatic function. There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.02 [0.59 to 1.76]; metabolite 1: 0.95 [0.52 to 1.71]; metabolite 2: 1.37 [0.71 to 2.62] and metabolite 3: 0.62 [0.33 to 1.16]). Due to limited information on safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic disease has not been studied. Mifepristone is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic disease. Drug-Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate a potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions by mifepristone and/or its metabolites with substrates of CYP2A6, CYP2C8/2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In vitro studies also indicated an interaction potential for drug transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In vitro studies indicate mifepristone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A, and that mifepristone also inhibits and induces CYP3A. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions (see Table 3) Table 3.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Mifepristone is a selective antagonist of the progesterone receptor at low doses and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) at higher doses. Mifepristone has high affinity for the GR-II receptor but little affinity for the GR-I (MR, mineralocorticoid) receptor. In addition, mifepristone appears to have little or no affinity for estrogen, muscarinic, histaminic, or monoamine receptors."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Because mifepristone acts at the receptor level to block the effects of cortisol, its antagonistic actions affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in such a way as to further increase circulating cortisol levels while, at the same time, blocking their effects. Mifepristone and the three active metabolites have greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor [100% (mifepristone), 61% (metabolite 1), 48% (metabolite 2), and 45% (metabolite 3)] than either dexamethasone (23%) or cortisol (9%)."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, time to peak plasma concentrations of mifepristone occurred between 1 and 2 hours following single dose, and between 1 and 4 hours following multiple doses of 600 mg of mifepristone in healthy volunteers. Mean plasma concentrations of three active metabolites of mifepristone peak between 2 and 8 hours after multiple doses of 600 mg/day, and the combined concentrations of the metabolites exceed that of the parent mifepristone. Exposure to mifepristone is substantially less than dose proportional. Time to steady state is within 2 weeks, and the mean (SD) half-life of the parent mifepristone was 85 (61) hours following multiple doses of 600 mg/day of mifepristone. Studies evaluating the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of mifepristone demonstrate a significant increase in plasma levels of mifepristone when dosed with food. To achieve consistent plasma drug concentrations, patients should be instructed to always take their medication with meals. Distribution Mifepristone is highly bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and approaches saturation at doses of 100 mg (2.5 \u00b5M) or more. Mifepristone and its metabolites also bind to albumin and are distributed to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). As determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, binding of mifepristone and its three active metabolites to human plasma proteins was concentration-dependent. Binding was approximately 99.2% for mifepristone, and ranged from 96.1% to 98.9% for the three active metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) has been shown to be involved in mifepristone metabolism in human liver microsomes. Two of the known active metabolites are the product of demethylation (one monodemethylated and one di-demethylated), while a third active metabolite results from hydroxylation (monohydroxylated). Elimination and Excretion Excretion is primarily (approximately 90%) via the fecal route. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min, but not on dialysis) was evaluated following multiple doses of 1,200 mg mifepristone for 7 days. Mean exposure to mifepristone increased 31%, with similar or smaller increases in metabolite exposure as compared to subjects with normal renal function (CrCL \u226590 mL/min). There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.21 [0.71 to 2.06]; metabolite 1: 1.43 [0.84 to 2.44]; metabolite 2: 1.18 [0.64 to 2.17] and metabolite 3: 1.19 [0.71 to 1.99]). No change in the initial dose of mifepristone is needed for renal impairment; the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was evaluated in a single- and multiple-dose study (600 mg for 7 days). The pharmacokinetics in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal hepatic function. There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.02 [0.59 to 1.76]; metabolite 1: 0.95 [0.52 to 1.71]; metabolite 2: 1.37 [0.71 to 2.62] and metabolite 3: 0.62 [0.33 to 1.16]). Due to limited information on safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic disease has not been studied. Mifepristone is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic disease. Drug-Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate a potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions by mifepristone and/or its metabolites with substrates of CYP2A6, CYP2C8/2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In vitro studies also indicated an interaction potential for drug transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In vitro studies indicate mifepristone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A, and that mifepristone also inhibits and induces CYP3A. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions (see Table 3) Table 3.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mifepristone was evaluated for carcinogenicity potential in rats and mice. Rats were dosed for up to two years at doses of 5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 125 mg/kg of mifepristone. The high dose was the maximum tolerated dose, but exposure at all doses was below exposure at the maximum clinical dose based on AUC comparison. Female rats had a statistically significant increase in follicular cell adenomas/carcinomas and liver adenomas. It is plausible that these tumors are due to drug-induced enzyme metabolism, a mechanism not considered clinically relevant, but studies confirming this mechanism were not conducted with mifepristone. Mice were also tested for up to 2 years at mifepristone doses up to the maximum tolerated dose of 125 mg/kg, which provided exposure below the maximum clinical dose based on AUC. No drug-related tumors were seen in mice. Mifepristone was not genotoxic in a battery of bacterial, yeast, and mammalian in vitro assays, and an in vivo micronucleus study in mice. The pharmacological activity of mifepristone disrupts the estrus cycle of adult rats at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (less than human exposure at the maximum clinical dose, based on body surface area). However, following withdrawal of treatment and subsequent resumption of the estrus cycle, there was no effect on reproductive function when mated. A single subcutaneous dose of mifepristone (up to 100 mg/kg) to rats on the first day after birth did not adversely affect future reproductive function in males or females, although the onset of puberty was slightly premature in dosed females. Repeated doses of mifepristone (1 mg every other day) to neonatal rats resulted in potentially adverse fertility effects, including oviduct and ovary malformations in females, delayed male puberty, deficient male sexual behavior, reduced testicular size, and lowered ejaculation frequency."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Cushing\u2019s Syndrome An uncontrolled, open-label, 24-week, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone in the treatment of endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The study enrolled 50 subjects with clinical and biochemical evidence of hypercortisolemia despite prior surgical treatment and radiotherapy. The reasons for medical treatment were failed surgery, recurrence of disease, and poor medical candidate for surgery. Forty-three patients (86%) had Cushing\u2019s disease, four patients (8%) had ectopic ACTH secretion, and three (6%) had adrenal carcinoma. Baseline characteristics included: mean age of 45 years (range 26 to 71), mean BMI of 36 kg/m 2 (range 24 to 66), mean weight 100 kg (range 61 to 199), and mean waist circumference was 119 cm (range 89 to 178); 70% were female; 84% were white and 16% were black or African American. Baseline mean urinary free cortisol level was 365 mcg per 24 hr. Patients belonged to one of two cohorts: a \u201cdiabetes\u201d cohort (29 patients, 26 with type 2 diabetes and 3 with glucose intolerance), and a \u201chypertension\u201d cohort (21 patients). Efficacy was evaluated separately in the two cohorts. Mifepristone treatment was started in all patients at a dose of 300 mg once a day. The study protocol allowed an increase in dose to 600 mg after 2 weeks, and then by additional 300 mg increments every 4 weeks to a maximum of 900 mg per day for patients <60 kg, or 1,200 mg per day for patients >60 kg, based on clinical tolerance and clinical response. Results in the diabetes cohort Patients in the diabetes cohort underwent standard oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline and periodically during the clinical study. Anti-diabetic medications were allowed but had to be kept stable during the trial and patients had to be on stable anti-diabetic regimens prior to enrollment. The primary efficacy analysis for the diabetes cohort was an analysis of responders. A responder was defined as a patient who had a \u226525% reduction from baseline in glucose AUC. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=25) defined as all patients who received a minimum of 30 days on mifepristone. Fifteen of 25 patients (60%) were treatment responders (95% CI: 39%, 78%). Mean HbA1c was 7.4% in the 24 patients with HbA1c values at baseline and Week 24. For these 24 patients mean reduction in HbA1c was 1.1% (95% CI -1.6, -0.7) from baseline to the end of the trial. Fourteen of 24 patients had above normal HbA1c levels at baseline, ranging between 6.7% and 10.4%; all of these patients had reductions in HbA1c by the end of the study (range -0.4 to -4.4%) and eight of 14 patients (57%) normalized HbA1c levels at trial end. Antidiabetic medications were reduced in 7 of the 15 DM subjects taking antidiabetic medication and remained constant in the others. Results in the hypertension cohort There were no changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trial relative to baseline in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=21). Signs and symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome in both cohorts Individual patients showed varying degrees of improvement in Cushing's syndrome manifestations such as cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae, psychiatric symptoms, and excess total body weight. Because of the variability in clinical presentation and variability of response in this open label trial, it is uncertain whether these changes could be ascribed to the effects of mifepristone."

Dosing and titration The daily dose of mifepristone may be increased in 300 mg increments. The dose of mifepristone may be increased to a maximum of 1200 mg once daily but should not exceed 20 mg/kg per day. Increases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 2-4 weeks. Decisions about dose increases should be based on a clinical assessment of tolerability and degree of improvement in Cushing's syndrome manifestations. Changes in glucose control, anti-diabetic medication requirements, insulin levels, and psychiatric symptoms may provide an early assessment of response (within 6 weeks) and may help guide early dose titration. Improvements in cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae, and body weight occur over a longer period of time and, along with measures of glucose control, may be used to determine dose changes beyond the first 2 months of therapy. Careful and gradual titration of mifepristone accompanied by monitoring for recognized adverse reactions [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.2 ) ] may reduce the risk of severe adverse reactions. Dose reduction or even dose discontinuation may be needed in some clinical situations. If mifepristone treatment is interrupted, it should be reinitiated at the lowest dose (300 mg). If treatment was interrupted because of adverse reactions, the titration should aim for a dose lower than the one that resulted in treatment interruption. 2.3 Dosing in Renal Impairment No change in initial dose of mifepristone is required in renal impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. [See Renal Impairment ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 2.4 Dosing in Hepatic Impairment No change in the initial dose of mifepristone is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. Mifepristone should not be used in severe hepatic impairment. [See Hepatic Impairment ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 2.5 Concomitant Administration with CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole may increase exposure to mifepristone. Mifepristone should be used in combination with strong CYP3A inhibitors only when necessary. [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] Administration of mifepristone to patients already being treated with strong CYP3A inhibitors: Start at a dose of 300 mg. If clinically indicated, titrate to a maximum of 900 mg. Administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors to patients already being treated with mifepristone: Adjust the dose of mifepristone according to Table 1 . Table 1.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Adrenal insufficiency : Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency ( 5.1 ). Hypokalemia : Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to treatment and monitored for during treatment ( 5.2 ). Vaginal bleeding and endometrial changes : Women may experience endometrial thickening or unexpected vaginal bleeding. Use with caution if patient also has a hemorrhagic disorder or is on anti-coagulant therapy ( 5.3 ). QT interval prolongation : Avoid use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, or in patients with potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval ( 5.4 ). Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use can increase mifepristone plasma levels. Use only when necessary and limit mifepristone dose to 900 mg ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Adrenal Insufficiency Patients receiving mifepristone may experience adrenal insufficiency. Because serum cortisol levels remain elevated and may even increase during treatment with mifepristone, serum cortisol levels do not provide an accurate assessment of hypoadrenalism in patients receiving mifepristone. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including weakness, nausea, increased fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, discontinue treatment with mifepristone immediately and administer glucocorticoids without delay. High doses of supplemental glucocorticoids may be needed to overcome the glucocorticoid receptor blockade produced by mifepristone. Factors considered in deciding on the duration of glucocorticoid treatment should include the long half-life of mifepristone (85 hours). Treatment with mifepristone at a lower dose can be resumed after resolution of adrenal insufficiency. Patients should also be evaluated for precipitating causes of hypoadrenalism (infection, trauma, etc.). 5.2 Hypokalemia In a study of patients with Cushing's syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with mifepristone. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating mifepristone. During mifepristone administration, serum potassium should be measured 1 to 2 weeks after starting or increasing the dose of mifepristone and periodically thereafter. Hypokalemia can occur at any time during mifepristone treatment. Mifepristone-induced hypokalemia should be treated with intravenous or oral potassium supplementation based on event severity. If hypokalemia persists in spite of potassium supplementation, consider adding mineralocorticoid antagonists. 5.3 Vaginal Bleeding and Endometrial Changes Being an antagonist of the progesterone receptor, mifepristone promotes unopposed endometrial proliferation that may result in endometrium thickening, cystic dilatation of endometrial glands, and vaginal bleeding. Mifepristone should be used with caution in women who have hemorrhagic disorders or are receiving concurrent anticoagulant therapy. Women who experience vaginal bleeding during mifepristone treatment should be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation. 5.4 QT Interval Prolongation Mifepristone and its metabolites block IKr. Mifepristone prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. There is little or no experience with high exposure, concomitant dosing with other QT-prolonging drugs, or potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval. [See Warnings & Precautions ( 5.6 )] To minimize risk, the lowest effective dose should always be used. 5.5 Exacerbation/Deterioration of Conditions Treated with Corticosteroids Use of mifepristone in patients who receive corticosteroids for other conditions (e.g., autoimmune disorders) may lead to exacerbation or deterioration of such conditions, as mifepristone antagonizes the desired effects of glucocorticoid in these clinical settings. For medical conditions in which chronic corticosteroid therapy is lifesaving (e.g., immunosuppression in organ transplantation), mifepristone is contraindicated. [See Contraindications (4.3)] 5.6 Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Mifepristone should be used with caution in patients taking ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole, as these could increase the concentration of mifepristone in the blood. The benefit of concomitant use of these agents should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. Mifepristone should be used in combination with strong CYP3A inhibitors only when necessary, and in such cases the dose should be limited to 900 mg per day. [See Warnings & Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.7 Pneumocystis jiroveci Infection Patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome are at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia during mifepristone treatment. Patients may present with respiratory distress shortly after initiation of mifepristone. Appropriate diagnostic tests should be undertaken and treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci should be considered. 5.8 Potential Effects of Hypercortisolemia Mifepristone does not reduce serum cortisol levels. Elevated cortisol levels may activate mineralocorticoid receptors which are also expressed in cardiac tissues. Caution should be used in patients with underlying heart conditions including heart failure and coronary vascular disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in Cushing's syndrome (\u2265 20%): nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood potassium, arthralgia, vomiting, peripheral edema, hypertension, dizziness, decreased appetite, endometrial hypertrophy ( 6 ). To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Corcept Therapeutics at 1-855-844-3270 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Safety data on the use of mifepristone are available from 50 patients with Cushing's syndrome enrolled in an uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center trial (Study 400). Forty-three patients had Cushing's disease and all except one had previously undergone pituitary surgery. Four patients had ectopic ACTH secretion, and three had adrenal carcinoma. Patients were treated for up to 24 weeks. A dose of 300 mg per day was administered for the initial 14 days; thereafter, the dose could be escalated in increments of 300 mg per day based on assessments of tolerability and clinical response. Doses were escalated up to 900 mg per day for patients <60 kg, or 1200 mg per day for patients >60 kg. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (reported in \u226520% of patients, regardless of relationship to mifepristone) were nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood potassium, arthralgia, vomiting, peripheral edema, hypertension, dizziness, decreased appetite, and endometrial hypertrophy. Drug-related adverse events resulted in dose interruption or reduction in study drug in 40% of patients. The adverse reactions that occurred in \u226510% of the Cushing's syndrome patients receiving mifepristone, regardless of relationship to mifepristone, are shown in Table 2 . Table 2. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in \u226510% of Cushing's Syndrome Patients Receiving mifepristone Body System/Adverse Reaction Percent (%) of Patients Reporting Event (n = 50) *The denominator was 26 females who had baseline and end-of-trial transvaginal ultrasound Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 48 Vomiting 26 Dry mouth 18 Diarrhea 12 Constipation 10 General disorders and administration/site conditions Fatigue 48 Edema peripheral 26 Pain 14 Nervous system disorders Headache 44 Dizziness 22 Somnolence 10 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia 30 Back pain 16 Myalgia 14 Pain in extremity 12 Investigations Blood potassium decreased 34 Thyroid function test abnormal 18 Infections and infestations Sinusitis 14 Nasopharyngitis 12 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite 20 Anorexia 10 Vascular disorders Hypertension 24 Reproductive system and breast disorders Endometrial hypertrophy 38* Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 16 Psychiatric disorders Anxiety 10 Laboratory Tests Reductions in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels have been observed following treatment with mifepristone. In study subjects that experienced declines in HDL-C, levels returned to baseline following discontinuation of drug. The clinical significance of the treatment-related reduction in HDL-C levels in patients with Cushing's syndrome is not known. In a study of patients with Cushing's syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with mifepristone. In these cases, hypokalemia responded to treatment with potassium supplementation and/or mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy (e.g., spironolactone or eplerenone). Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating mifepristone. [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were seen in subjects treated with mifepristone. Of the 42 subjects with detectable TSH at baseline, eight (19%) had increases in TSH above the normal range, while remaining asymptomatic. The TSH levels returned to normal in most patients without intervention when mifepristone was discontinued at the end of the study. Vaginal Bleeding and Endometrial Changes In Study 400, the thickness of the endometrium increased from a mean of 6.14 mm at baseline (n=23) to 15.7 mm at end-of-trial (n=18) in premenopausal women; in postmenopausal women the increase was from 2.75 mm (n=6) to 7.35 mm (n=8). Endometrial thickness above the upper limit of normal was reported in 10/26 females who had baseline and end-of-trial transvaginal ultrasound (38%). The endometrial thickness returned to the normal range in 3 out of 10 patients 6 weeks after treatment cessation at the end of the study. Vaginal bleeding occurred in 5 out of 35 females (14%). Two of five subjects with vaginal bleeding had normal endometrial thickness. Endometrial biopsies were performed in six patients; five of these patients had endometrial thickening. No endometrial carcinoma was detected in the sampled cases. Additional Data from Clinical Trials The following are adverse events that were reported in Study 400 at frequencies of \u2265 5% to 10%, and may be related to mifepristone's mechanism of action: Gastrointestinal disorders: gastroesophageal reflux, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, malaise, edema, pitting edema, thirst Investigations: blood triglycerides increased Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscular weakness, flank pain, musculoskeletal chest pain Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive system and breast disorders: vaginal hemorrhage, metrorrhagia [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Adrenal Insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency was reported in two subjects (4%) in Study 400. The most typical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were nausea and decreased appetite. No hypotension or hypoglycemia was reported during the events. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in both cases with mifepristone interruption and /or dexamethasone administration. Rash Generalized, maculo-papular rash was reported in 2 subjects (4%) in Study 400. Two additional subjects developed pruritus (4%). None resulted in discontinuation of mifepristone, and all the events resolved by the end of the study. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post approval use of mifepristone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Angioedema"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Based on the long terminal half-life of mifepristone after reaching steady state, at least 2 weeks should elapse after cessation of mifepristone before initiating or increasing the dose of any interacting concomitant medication. Drugs metabolized by CYP3A: Administer drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A at the lowest dose when used with mifepristone ( 7.1 ). CYP3A inhibitors: Caution should be used when mifepristone is used with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Limit mifepristone dose to 900 mg per day when used with strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 7.2 ). CYP3A inducers: Do not use mifepristone with CYP3A inducers ( 7.3 ). Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8/2C9: Use the lowest dose of CYP2C8/2C9 substrates when used with mifepristone ( 7.4 ). Drugs metabolized by CYP2B6: Use of mifepristone should be done with caution with bupropion and efavirenz ( 7.5 ). Hormonal contraceptives: Do not use with mifepristone ( 7.6 ). 7.1 Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP3A, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP3A is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug. Discontinuation or dose reduction of such medications may be necessary with mifepristone co-administration. Mifepristone increased the exposure to simvastatin and simvastatin acid significantly in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of simvastatin or lovastatin is contraindicated because of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. [See Contraindications (4.2), Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] The exposure of other substrates of CYP3A with narrow therapeutic ranges, such as cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, may be increased by concomitant administration with mifepristone. Therefore, the concomitant use of such CYP3A substrates with mifepristone is contraindicated. [See Contraindications (4.2)] Other drugs with similar high first pass metabolism in which CYP3A is the primary route of metabolism should be used with extreme caution if co-administered with mifepristone. The lowest possible dose and/or a decreased frequency of dosing must be used with therapeutic drug monitoring when possible. Use of alternative drugs without these metabolic characteristics is advised when possible with concomitant mifepristone. If drugs that undergo low first pass metabolism by CYP3A or drugs in which CYP3A is not the major metabolic route are co-administered with mifepristone, use the lowest dose of concomitant medication necessary, with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 CYP3A Inhibitors Medications that inhibit CYP3A could increase plasma mifepristone concentrations and dose reduction of mifepristone may be required. Ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir /ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole may increase exposure to mifepristone. Caution should be used when strong CYP3A inhibitors are prescribed in combination with mifepristone. The benefit of concomitant use of these agents should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. The dose of mifepristone should be limited to 900 mg, and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be used only when necessary. [See Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings & Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.3 CYP3A Inducers No medications that induce CYP3A have been studied when co-administered with mifepristone. Avoid co-administration of mifepristone and CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort. 7.4 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C8/2C9 Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2C8/2C9, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C8/2C9 is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug. Mifepristone significantly increased exposure of fluvastatin, a typical CYP2C8/2C9 substrate, in healthy subjects. When given concomitantly with mifepristone, drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8/2C9 (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and repaglinide) should be used at the smallest recommended doses, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse effects. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2B6 Mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and may cause significant increases in exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2B6 such as bupropion and efavirenz. Since no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of mifepristone on substrates of CYP2B6, the concomitant use of bupropion and efavirenz should be undertaken with caution. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Mifepristone is a progesterone-receptor antagonist and will interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, non-hormonal contraceptive methods should be used. [See Use In Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]"

Available data limited to exposure following a single dose of mifepristone during pregnancy showed a higher rate of major birth defects compared to the general population comparator (See Data ) . Mifepristone administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis caused pregnancy loss in all species at clinically relevant doses based on body surface area comparisons (See Data ) . The inhibition of both endogenous and exogenous progesterone by mifepristone at the progesterone receptor results in pregnancy loss. If mifepristone is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [See Contraindications ( 4 )] The estimated risk of fetal loss is elevated in patients with active Cushing's syndrome (24-30%), and the risk of major birth defects is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data There are no data on long term exposure to mifepristone in pregnancy. Available data are limited to exposure to a single dose of mifepristone for pregnancy termination. In a prospective study in France of 46 pregnancies exposed to a single dose of mifepristone alone and 59 pregnancies exposed to a single dose of mifepristone and misoprostol, the overall major birth defect rate (4%) was greater than the general population background rate of 2 to 3% (2 birth defects in each group). There was no pattern of birth defects identified. Animal Data Reproductive studies were performed in mice, rats and rabbits at doses of 0.25 to 4.0 mg/kg (less than human exposure at the maximum clinical dose, based on body surface area). Because of the anti-progestational activity of mifepristone, fetal losses were much higher than in control animals. Skull deformities were detected in rabbit studies at less than human exposure, although mifepristone did not cause any adverse developmental effects in rats or mice during organogenesis. These deformities were most likely due to the mechanical effects of uterine contractions resulting from antagonism of the progesterone receptor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mifepristone is present in human milk, however, there are no data on the amount of mifepristone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production during long term use of mifepristone (see Data) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mifepristone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mifepristone or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant, women who discontinue or interrupt mifepristone treatment may consider pumping and discarding milk during treatment and for 18-21 days (5-6 half-lives) after the last dose, before breastfeeding. Data Available published data based on intake of a single dose of 600 mg of mifepristone in 10 breastfeeding women who were 6-12 months postpartum showed a small amount in breast milk (the estimated relative infant dose was 0.5%). The half-life of mifepristone is longer with repeat dosing compared to a single dose; therefore, there may be greater exposure with long term use. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Due to its anti-progestational activity, mifepristone causes pregnancy loss. Perform pregnancy testing before the initiation of treatment with mifepristone or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days in females of reproductive potential. Contraception Recommend non-hormonal contraception for the duration of treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Mifepristone interferes with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. [See Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mifepristone in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with mifepristone did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger people. 8.6 Renal Impairment The maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day in renally impaired patients. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied, and mifepristone should not be used in these patients . [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]"

      "11 DESCRIPTION Mifepristone is a cortisol receptor blocker for oral administration. The chemical name of mifepristone is 11\u03b2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-17\u03b2-hydroxy-17\u03b1-(1-propynyl)-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one. The chemical formula is C 29 H 35 NO 2 ; the molecular weight is 429.60, and the structural formula is: Mifepristone demonstrates a pH-related solubility profile. The greatest solubility is achieved in acidic media (~ 25 mg/mL at pH 1.5) and solubility declines rapidly as the pH is increased. At pH values above 2.5 the solubility of mifepristone is less than 1 mg/mL. Each mifepristone tablet for oral use contains 300 mg of mifepristone. The inactive ingredients of mifepristone tablets are silicified microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, D&C yellow 10 aluminum lake, polysorbate 80, and FD&C yellow 6 aluminum lake.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mifepristone is a selective antagonist of the progesterone receptor at low doses and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) at higher doses. Mifepristone has high affinity for the GR-II receptor but little affinity for the GR-I (MR, mineralocorticoid) receptor. In addition, mifepristone appears to have little or no affinity for estrogen, muscarinic, histaminic, or monoamine receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Because mifepristone acts at the receptor level to block the effects of cortisol, its antagonistic actions affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in such a way as to further increase circulating cortisol levels while, at the same time, blocking their effects. Mifepristone and the three active metabolites have greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor [100% (mifepristone), 61% (metabolite 1), 48% (metabolite 2), and 45% (metabolite 3)] than either dexamethasone (23%) or cortisol (9%). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, time to peak plasma concentrations of mifepristone occurred between 1 and 2 hours following single dose, and between 1 and 4 hours following multiple doses of 600 mg of mifepristone in healthy volunteers. Mean plasma concentrations of three active metabolites of mifepristone peak between 2 and 8 hours after multiple doses of 600 mg/day, and the combined concentrations of the metabolites exceed that of the parent mifepristone. Exposure to mifepristone is substantially less than dose proportional. Time to steady state is within 2 weeks, and the mean (SD) half-life of the parent mifepristone was 85 (61) hours following multiple doses of 600 mg/day of mifepristone. Studies evaluating the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of mifepristone demonstrate a significant increase in plasma levels of mifepristone when dosed with food. To achieve consistent plasma drug concentrations, patients should be instructed to always take their medication with meals. Distribution Mifepristone is highly bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and approaches saturation at doses of 100 mg (2.5 \u03bcM) or more. Mifepristone and its metabolites also bind to albumin and are distributed to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). As determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, binding of mifepristone and its three active metabolites to human plasma proteins was concentration-dependent. Binding was approximately 99.2% for mifepristone, and ranged from 96.1 to 98.9% for the three active metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) has been shown to be involved in mifepristone metabolism in human liver microsomes. Two of the known active metabolites are the product of demethylation (one monodemethylated and one di-demethylated), while a third active metabolite results from hydroxylation (monohydroxylated). Elimination and Excretion Excretion is primarily (approximately 90%) via the fecal route. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min, but not on dialysis) was evaluated following multiple doses of 1200 mg mifepristone for 7 days. Mean exposure to mifepristone increased 31%, with similar or smaller increases in metabolite exposure as compared to subjects with normal renal function (CrCL \u2265 90 mL/min). There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.21 [0.71-2.06]; metabolite 1: 1.43 [0.84-2.44]; metabolite 2: 1.18 [0.64-2.17] and metabolite 3: 1.19 [0.71-1.99]). No change in the initial dose of mifepristone is needed for renal impairment; the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was evaluated in a single- and multiple-dose study (600 mg for 7 days). The pharmacokinetics in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal hepatic function. There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.02 [0.59-1.76]; metabolite 1: 0.95 [0.52-1.71]; metabolite 2: 1.37 [0.71-2.62] and metabolite 3: 0.62 [0.33-1.16]). Due to limited information on safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic disease has not been studied. Mifepristone is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic disease. Drug-Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate a potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions by mifepristone and/or its metabolites with substrates of CYP2A6, CYP2C8/2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In vitro studies also indicated an interaction potential for drug transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In vitro studies indicate mifepristone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A, and that mifepristone also inhibits and induces CYP3A. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions (see Table 3 ) Table 3.

There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.02 [0.59-1.76]; metabolite 1: 0.95 [0.52-1.71]; metabolite 2: 1.37 [0.71-2.62] and metabolite 3: 0.62 [0.33-1.16]). Due to limited information on safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic disease has not been studied. Mifepristone is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic disease. Drug-Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate a potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions by mifepristone and/or its metabolites with substrates of CYP2A6, CYP2C8/2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In vitro studies also indicated an interaction potential for drug transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In vitro studies indicate mifepristone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A, and that mifepristone also inhibits and induces CYP3A. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions (see Table 3 ) Table 3.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mifepristone was evaluated for carcinogenicity potential in rats and mice. Rats were dosed for up to two years at doses of 5, 25, and 125 mg/kg of mifepristone. The high dose was the maximum tolerated dose, but exposure at all doses was below exposure at the maximum clinical dose based on AUC comparison. Female rats had a statistically significant increase in follicular cell adenomas/carcinomas and liver adenomas. It is plausible that these tumors are due to drug-induced enzyme metabolism, a mechanism not considered clinically relevant, but studies confirming this mechanism were not conducted with mifepristone. Mice were also tested for up to 2 years at mifepristone doses up to the maximum tolerated dose of 125 mg/kg, which provided exposure below the maximum clinical dose based on AUC. No drug-related tumors were seen in mice. Mifepristone was not genotoxic in a battery of bacterial, yeast, and mammalian in vitro assays, and an in vivo micronucleus study in mice. The pharmacological activity of mifepristone disrupts the estrus cycle of adult rats at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (less than human exposure at the maximum clinical dose, based on body surface area). However, following withdrawal of treatment and subsequent resumption of the estrus cycle, there was no effect on reproductive function when mated. A single subcutaneous dose of mifepristone (up to 100 mg/kg) to rats on the first day after birth did not adversely affect future reproductive function in males or females, although the onset of puberty was slightly premature in dosed females. Repeated doses of mifepristone (1 mg every other day) to neonatal rats resulted in potentially adverse fertility effects, including oviduct and ovary malformations in females, delayed male puberty, deficient male sexual behavior, reduced testicular size, and lowered ejaculation frequency."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Cushing's Syndrome An uncontrolled, open-label, 24-week, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone in the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The study enrolled 50 subjects with clinical and biochemical evidence of hypercortisolemia despite prior surgical treatment and radiotherapy. The reasons for medical treatment were failed surgery, recurrence of disease, and poor medical candidate for surgery. Forty-three patients (86%) had Cushing's disease, four patients (8%) had ectopic ACTH secretion, and three (6%) had adrenal carcinoma. Baseline characteristics included: mean age of 45 years (range 26 to 71), mean BMI of 36 kg/m 2 (range 24 to 66), mean weight 100 kg (range 61 to 199), and mean waist circumference was 119 cm (range 89 to 178); 70% were female; 84% were white and 16% were black or African American. Baseline mean urinary free cortisol level was 365 \u03bcg per 24 hr. Patients belonged to one of two cohorts: a \u201cdiabetes\u201d cohort (29 patients, 26 with type 2 diabetes and 3 with glucose intolerance), and a \u201chypertension\u201d cohort (21 patients). Efficacy was evaluated separately in the two cohorts. Mifepristone treatment was started in all patients at a dose of 300 mg once a day. The study protocol allowed an increase in dose to 600 mg after 2 weeks, and then by additional 300 mg increments every 4 weeks to a maximum of 900 mg per day for patients <60 kg, or 1200 mg per day for patients >60 kg, based on clinical tolerance and clinical response. Results in the diabetes cohort Patients in the diabetes cohort underwent standard oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline and periodically during the clinical study. Anti-diabetic medications were allowed but had to be kept stable during the trial and patients had to be on stable anti-diabetic regimens prior to enrollment. The primary efficacy analysis for the diabetes cohort was an analysis of responders. A responder was defined as a patient who had a \u2265 25% reduction from baseline in glucose AUC. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=25) defined as all patients who received a minimum of 30 days on mifepristone. Fifteen of 25 patients (60%) were treatment responders (95% CI: 39%,78%). Mean HbA1c was 7.4% in the 24 patients with HbA1c values at baseline and Week 24. For these 24 patients mean reduction in HbA1c was 1.1% (95% CI -1.6, -0.7) from baseline to the end of the trial. Fourteen of 24 patients had above normal HbA1c levels at baseline, ranging between 6.7% and 10.4%; all of these patients had reductions in HbA1c by the end of the study (range -0.4 to -4.4%) and eight of 14 patients (57%) normalized HbA1c levels at trial end. Antidiabetic medications were reduced in 7 of the 15 DM subjects taking antidiabetic medication and remained constant in the others. Results in the hypertension cohort There were no changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trial relative to baseline in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=21). Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome in both cohorts Individual patients showed varying degrees of improvement in Cushing's syndrome manifestations such as cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae, psychiatric symptoms, and excess total body weight. Because of the variability in clinical presentation and variability of response in this open label trial, it is uncertain whether these changes could be ascribed to the effects of mifepristone."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 200 mg mifepristone tablet on Day 1, followed 24 to 48 hours after mifepristone tablet dosing by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol. ( 2.1 ) Instruct the patient what to do if significant adverse reactions occur. ( 2.2 ) Follow-up is needed to confirm complete termination of pregnancy. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Dosing Regimen For purposes of this treatment, pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period. The duration of pregnancy may be determined from menstrual history and clinical examination. Assess the pregnancy by ultrasonographic scan if the duration of pregnancy is uncertain or if ectopic pregnancy is suspected. Remove any intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) before treatment with Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg begins [see Contraindications (4)] . The dosing regimen for Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol is: Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg orally + misoprostol 800 mcg buccally \u2022 Day One : Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg Administration One 200 mg tablets of Mifepristone is taken in a single oral dose. \u2022 Day Two or Three : Misoprostol Administration (minimum 24-hour interval between, Mifepristone Tablet, 200 mg and misoprostol) Four 200 mcg tablets (total dose 800 mcg) of misoprostol are taken by the buccal route. Tell the patient to place two 200 mcg misoprostol tablets in each cheek pouch (the area between the cheek and gums) for 30 minutes and then swallow any remnants with water or another liquid (see Figure 1 ). Patients taking Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg must take misoprostol within 24 to 48 hours after taking Mifepristone Tablets. The effectiveness of the regimen may be lower if misoprostol is administered less than 24 hours or more than 48 hours after mifepristone administration. Because most women will expel the pregnancy within 2 to 24 hours of taking misoprostol [see Clinical Studies (14)], discuss with the patient an appropriate location for them to be when taking the misoprostol, taking into account that expulsion could begin within 2 hours of administration. figure-1 2.2 Patient Management Following Misoprostol Administration During the period immediately following the administration of misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Give the patient: Instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive vaginal bleeding or other adverse reactions occur A phone number to call if the patient has questions following the administration of the misoprostol The name and phone number of the healthcare provider who will be handling emergencies. 2.3 Post-treatment Assessment: Day 7 to 14 Patients should follow-up with their healthcare provider approximately 7 to 14 days after the administration of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. This assessment is very important to confirm that complete termination of pregnancy has occurred and to evaluate the degree of bleeding. Termination can be confirmed by medical history, clinical examination, human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) testing, or ultrasonographic scan. Lack of bleeding following treatment usually indicates failure; however, prolonged or heavy bleeding is not proof of a complete abortion. The existence of debris in the uterus (e.g., if seen on ultrasonography) following the treatment procedure will not necessarily require surgery for its removal. Patients should expect to experience vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9 to 16 days. Women report experiencing heavy bleeding for a median duration of 2 days. Up to 8% of women may experience some type of bleeding for more than 30 days. Persistence of heavy or moderate vaginal bleeding at the time of follow-up, however, could indicate an incomplete abortion. If complete expulsion has not occurred, but the pregnancy is not ongoing, patients may be treated with another dose of misoprostol 800 mcg buccally. There have been rare reports of uterine rupture in women who took Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol, including women with prior uterine rupture or uterine scar and women who received multiple doses of misoprostol within 24 hours. Patients who choose to use a repeat dose of misoprostol should have a follow-up visit with their healthcare provider in approximately 7 days to assess for complete termination. Surgical evacuation is recommended to manage ongoing pregnancies after medical abortion [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise the patient whether you will provide such care or will refer them to another provider as part of counseling prior to prescribing Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. 2.4 Contact for Consultation For consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with an expert in mifepristone, call Evita Solutions LLC at 1-866-718-0098."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ectopic pregnancy: Exclude before treatment. ( 5.4 ) Rhesus immunization: Prevention needed as for surgical abortion. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Infection and Sepsis As with other types of abortion, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg [see Boxed Warning ] . Healthcare providers evaluating a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion should be alert to the possibility of this rare event. A sustained (> 4 hours) fever of 100.4\u00b0F or higher, severe abdominal pain, or pelvic tenderness in the days after a medical abortion may be an indication of infection. A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out sepsis (e.g., from Clostridium sordellii ) if a patient reports abdominal pain or discomfort or general malaise (including weakness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. No causal relationship between Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been established. Clostridium sordellii infections have also been reported very rarely following childbirth (vaginal delivery and caesarian section), and in other gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions. 5.2 Uterine Bleeding Uterine bleeding occurs in almost all patients during a medical abortion. Prolonged heavy bleeding (soaking through two thick full-size sanitary pads per hour for two consecutive hours) may be a sign of incomplete abortion or other complications and prompt medical or surgical intervention may be needed to prevent the development of hypovolemic shock. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience prolonged heavy vaginal bleeding following a medical abortion [see Boxed Warning ] . Women should expect to experience vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9 to 16 days. Women report experiencing heavy bleeding for a median duration of 2 days. Up to 8% of all subjects may experience some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. In general, the duration of bleeding and spotting increased as the duration of the pregnancy increased. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell count may occur in patient who bleed heavily. Excessive uterine bleeding usually requires treatment by uterotonics, vasoconstrictor drugs, surgical uterine evacuation, administration of saline infusions, and/or blood transfusions. Based on data from several large clinical trials, vasoconstrictor drugs were used in 4.3% of all subjects, there was a decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL in 5.5% of subjects, and blood transfusions were administered to \u22640.1% of subjects. Because heavy bleeding requiring surgical uterine evacuation occurs in about 1% of patients, special care should be given to patients with hemostatic disorders, hypocoagulability, or severe anemia. 5.3 Mifepristone REMS Program Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Mifepristone REMS Program, because of the risks of serious complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]. Notable requirements of the Mifepristone REMS Program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program by completing the Prescriber Agreement Form. Patients must sign a Patient Agreement Form. Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg must only be dispensed to patients by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or by certified pharmacies on prescriptions issued by certified prescribers. Further information is available at 1-866-718-0098. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients with a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy because mifepristone tablets is not effective for terminating ectopic pregnancies [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Healthcare providers should remain alert to the possibility that a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion could have an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy because some of the expected symptoms experienced with a medical abortion (abdominal pain, uterine bleeding) may be similar to those of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an ectopic pregnancy may have been missed even if the patient underwent ultrasonography prior to being prescribed mifepristone tablets, 200 mg. Patients who became pregnant with an IUD in place should be assessed for ectopic pregnancy. 5.5 Rhesus Immunization The use of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg is assumed to require the same preventive measures as those taken prior to and during surgical abortion to prevent rhesus immunization."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Evita Solutions LLC at 1-866-718-0098 or medical@evitasolutionsllc.com or www.medicalabortionpill.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Information presented on common adverse reactions relies solely on data from U.S. studies, because rates reported in non-U.S. studies were markedly lower and are not likely generalizable to the U.S. population. In three U.S. clinical studies totaling 1,248 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24 to 48 hours later by misoprostol 800 mcg buccally, women reported adverse reactions in diaries and in interviews at the follow-up visit. These studies enrolled generally healthy women of reproductive age without contraindications to mifepristone or misoprostol use according to the Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg product label.Gestational age was assessed prior to study enrollment using the date of the woman's last menstrual period, clinical evaluation, and/or ultrasound examination. About 85% of patients report at least one adverse reaction following administration of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol, and many can be expected to report more than one such reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>15%) were nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness (see Table 1). The frequency of adverse reactions varies between studies and may be dependent on many factors including the patient population and gestational age. Abdominal pain/cramping is expected in all medical abortion patients and its incidence is not reported in clinical studies. Treatment with Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol is designed to induce uterine bleeding and cramping to cause termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. Uterine bleeding and cramping are expected consequences of the action of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol as used in the treatment procedure. Most patients can expect bleeding more heavily than they do during a heavy menstrual period [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in U.S. clinical studies with incidence >15% of women.

Information on serious adverse reactions was reported in six U.S. and four non-U.S. clinical studies, totaling 30,966 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24 to 48 hours later by misoprostol 800 mcg buccally. Serious adverse reaction rates were similar between U.S. and non-U.S. studies, so rates from both U.S. and non-U.S. studies are presented. In the U.S. studies, one studied women through 56 days gestation, four through 63 days gestation, and one through 70 days gestation, while in the non-U.S. studies, two studied women through 63 days gestation, and two through 70 days gestation. Serious adverse reactions were reported in <0.5% of women. Information from the U.S. and non-U.S. studies is presented in Table 2.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inducers can lower mifepristone concentrations. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase mifepristone concentrations. Use with caution. ( 7.2 ) CYP3A4 substrate concentrations can be increased. Caution with coadministration of substrates with narrow therapeutic margin. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Drugs that May Reduce Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg Exposure (Effect of CYP 3A4 Inducers on Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg) CYP450 3A4 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of mifepristone. CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, dexamethasone, St. John's Wort, and certain anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) may induce mifepristone metabolism (lowering serum concentrations of mifepristone). Whether this action has an impact on the efficacy of the dose regimen is unknown. Refer to the follow-up assessment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] to verify that treatment has been successful. 7.2 Drugs that May Increase Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg Exposure (Effect of CYP 3A4 Inhibitors on Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg) Although specific drug or food interactions with mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of this drug's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that ketoconazole, itraconazole erythromycin, and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum concentrations of mifepristone). Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg should be used with caution in patients currently or recently treated with CYP 3A4 inhibitors. 7.3 Effects of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg on Other Drugs (Effect of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg on CYP 3A4 Substrates) Based on in vitro inhibition information, coadministration of mifepristone may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates. Due to the slow elimination of mifepristone from the body, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when mifepristone is administered with drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic range."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Risk of fetal malformations in ongoing pregnancy if not terminated is unknown. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg is indicated, in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation. Risks to pregnant women are discussed throughout the labeling. Refer to misoprostol labeling for risks to pregnant patients with the use of misoprostol. The risk of adverse developmental outcomes with a continued pregnancy after a failed pregnancy termination with Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol is unknown; however, the process of a failed pregnancy termination could disrupt normal embryo-fetal development and result in adverse developmental effects. Birth defects have been reported with a continued pregnancy after a failed pregnancy termination with Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol. In animal reproduction studies, increased fetal losses were observed in mice, rats, and rabbits and skull deformities were observed in rabbits with administration of mifepristone at doses lower than the human exposure level based on body surface area. Data Animal Data In teratology studies in mice, rats and rabbits at doses of 0.25 to 4.0mg/kg (less than 1/100 to approximately 1/3 the human exposure based on body surface area), because of the antiprogestational activity of mifepristone, fetal losses were much higher than in control animals. Skull deformities were detected in rabbit studies at approximately 1/6 the human exposure, although no teratogenic effects of mifepristone have been observed to date in rats or mice. These deformities were most likely due to the mechanical effects of uterine contractions resulting from inhibition of progesterone action. 8.2 Lactation Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg is present in human milk. Limited data demonstrate undetectable to low levels of the drug in human milk with the relative (weight-adjusted) infant dose 0.5% or less as compared to maternal dosing. There is no information on the effects of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol in a breastfed infant or on milk production. Refer to misoprostol labeling for lactation information with the use of misoprostol. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg have been established in pregnant females. Data from a clinical study of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg that included a subset of 322 females under age 17 demonstrated a safety and efficacy profile similar to that observed in adults."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The anti-progestational activity of mifepristone results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone, resulting in effects on the uterus and cervix that, when combined with misoprostol, result in termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Use of Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol disrupts pregnancy by causing decidual necrosis, myometrial contractions, and cervical softening, leading to the expulsion of the products of conception. Doses of 1 mg/kg or greater of mifepristone have been shown to antagonize the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone in women. Antiglucocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity: Mifepristone also exhibits antiglucocorticoid and weak antiandrogenic activity. The activity of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in rats was inhibited following doses of 10 to 25 mg/kg of mifepristone. Doses of 4.5 mg/kg or greater in human beings resulted in a compensatory elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. Antiandrogenic activity was observed in rats following repeated administration of doses from 10 to 100 mg/kg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Mifepristone is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion with non-linear pharmacokinetics for C max after single oral doses of 200 mg and 600 mg in healthy subjects. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of a 200 mg mifepristone oral dose in females of childbearing age is 69%. Following oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg, mifepristone is rapidly absorbed, with a peak plasma concentration of 1.98 \u00b1 1.0 mg/L occurring approximately 90 minutes after ingestion. Following oral administration of a single dose of 200 mg in healthy men (n=8), mean C max was 1.77 \u00b1 0.7 mg/L occurring approximately 45 minutes after ingestion. Mean AUC 0-\u221e was 25.8 \u00b1 6.2 mg*hr/L. Distribution Mifepristone is 98% bound to plasma proteins, albumin, and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Binding to the latter protein is saturable, and the drug displays nonlinear kinetics with respect to plasma concentration and clearance. Elimination Following a distribution phase, elimination of mifepristone is slow at first (50% eliminated between 12 and 72 hours) and then becomes more rapid with a terminal elimination half-life of 18 hours. Metabolism Metabolism of mifepristone is primarily via pathways involving N-demethylation and terminal hydroxylation of the 17-propynyl chain. In vitro studies have shown that CYP450 3A4 is primarily responsible for the metabolism. The three major metabolites identified in humans are: (1) RU 42 633, the most widely found in plasma, is the N-monodemethylated metabolite; (2) RU 42 848, which results from the loss of two methyl groups from the 4-dimethylaminophenyl in position 11\u00df; and (3) RU 42 698, which results from terminal hydroxylation of the 17-propynyl chain. Excretion By 11 days after a 600 mg dose of tritiated compound, 83% of the drug has been accounted for by the feces and 9% by the urine. Serum concentrations are undetectable by 11 days. Specific Populations The effects of age, hepatic disease and renal disease on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of mifepristone have not been investigated."

Among the tests carried out were: Ames test with and without metabolic activation; gene conversion test in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 cells; forward mutation in Schizosaccharomyces pompe P1 cells; induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured HeLa cells; induction of chromosome aberrations in CHO cells; in vitro test for gene mutation in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells; and micronucleus test in mice. Impairment of Fertility In rats, administration of 0.3 mg/kg mifepristone per day caused severe disruption of the estrus cycles for the three weeks of the treatment period. Following resumption of the estrus cycle, animals were mated and no effects on reproductive performance were observed."

Success was defined as the complete expulsion of the products of conception without the need for surgical intervention. The overall rates of success and failure, shown by reason for failure based on 22 worldwide clinical studies (including 7 U.S. studies) appear in Table 3. The demographics of women who participated in the U.S. clinical studies varied depending on study location and represent the racial and ethnic variety of American females. Females of all reproductive ages were represented, including females less than 18 and more than 40 years of age; most were 27 years or younger.

Tell the patient to place two 200 mcg misoprostol tablets in each cheek pouch (the area between the cheek and gums) for 30 minutes and then swallow any remnants with water or another liquid (see Figure 1). Patients taking Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg must take misoprostol within 24 to 48 hours after taking Mifepristone. The effectiveness of the regimen may be lower if misoprostol is administered less than 24 hours or more than 48 hours after mifepristone administration. Because most women will expel the pregnancy within 2 to 24 hours of taking misoprostol [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , discuss with the patient an appropriate location for them to be when taking the misoprostol, taking into account that expulsion could begin within 2 hours of administration. Figure 1 2.2 Patient Management Following Misoprostol Administration During the period immediately following the administration of misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Give the patient: Instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive vaginal bleeding or other adverse reactions occur A phone number to call if the patient has questions following the administration of the misoprostol The name and phone number of the healthcare provider who will behandling emergencies. 2.3 Post-treatment Assessment: Day 7 to 14 Patients should follow-up with their healthcare provider approximately 7 to 14 days after the administration of Mifepristone. This assessment is very important to confirm that complete termination of pregnancy has occurred and to evaluate the degree of bleeding. Termination can be confirmed by medical history, clinical examination, human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) testing, or ultrasonographic scan. Lack of bleeding following treatment usually indicates failure; however, prolonged or heavy bleeding is not proof of a complete abortion. The existence of debris in the uterus (e.g., if seen on ultrasonography) following the treatment procedure will not necessarily require surgery for its removal. Patients should expect to experience vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9 to 16 days. Women report experiencing heavy bleeding for a median duration of 2 days. Up to 8% of women may experience some type of bleeding for more than 30 days. Persistence of heavy or moderate vaginal bleeding at the time of follow-up, however, could indicate an incomplete abortion. If complete expulsion has not occurred, but the pregnancy is not ongoing, patients may be treated with another dose of misoprostol 800mcg buccally. There have been rare reports of uterine rupture in women who took mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol, including women with prior uterine rupture or uterine scar and patients who received multiple doses of misoprostol within 24 hours. Patients who choose to use a repeat dose of misoprostol should have a follow-up visit with their healthcare provider in approximately 7 days to assess for complete termination. Surgical evacuation is recommended to manage ongoing pregnancies after medical abortion [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise the patient whether you will provide such care or will refer her to another provider as part of counseling prior to prescribing Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg. 2.4 Contact for Consultation For consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with an expert in mifepristone, call GenBioPro, Inc. at 1-855-MIFEINFO (1-855-643-3463)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ectopic pregnancy: Exclude before treatment. ( 5.4 ) Rhesus immunization: Prevention needed as for surgical abortion. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Infection and Sepsis As with other types of abortion, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg [see Boxed Warning ]. Healthcare providers evaluating a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion should be alert to the possibility of this rare event. A sustained (>4 hours) fever of 100.4\u00b0F or higher, severe abdominal pain, or pelvic tenderness in the days after a medical abortion may be an indication of infection. A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out sepsis (e.g., from Clostridium sordellii ) if a patient reports abdominal pain or discomfort or general malaise (including weakness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. No causal relationship between Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been established. Clostridium sordellii infections have also been reported very rarely following childbirth (vaginal delivery and caesarian section), and in other gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions. 5.2 Uterine Bleeding Uterine bleeding occurs in almost all patients during a medical abortion. Prolonged heavy bleeding (soaking through two thick full-size sanitary pads per hour for two consecutive hours) may be a sign of incomplete abortion or other complications and prompt medical or surgical intervention may be needed to prevent the development of hypovolemic shock. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience prolonged heavy vaginal bleeding following a medical abortion [see Boxed Warning ]. Women should expect to experience vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9 to 16 days. Women report experiencing heavy bleeding for a median duration of 2 days. Up to 8% of all subjects may experience some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. In general, the duration of bleeding and spotting increased as the duration of the pregnancy increased. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell count may occur in patients who bleed heavily. Excessive uterine bleeding usually requires treatment by uterotonics, vasoconstrictor drugs, surgical uterine evacuation, administration of saline infusions, and/or blood transfusions. Based on data from several large clinical trials, vasoconstrictor drugs were used in 4.3% of all subjects, there was a decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL in 5.5% of subjects, and blood transfusions were administered to \u22640.1% of subjects. Because heavy bleeding requiring surgical uterine evacuation occurs in about 1% of patients, special care should be given to patients with hemostatic disorders, hypocoagulability, or severe anemia. 5.3 Mifepristone REMS Program Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Mifepristone REMS Program, because of the risks of serious complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] Notable requirements of the Mifepristone REMS Program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program by completing the Prescriber Agreement Form Patients must sign a Patient Agreement Form Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg must be dispensed to patients by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or by certified pharmacies on prescriptions issued by certified prescribers Further information is available at 1-855-MIFEINFO (1-855-643-3463). 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients with a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy because mifepristone is not effective for terminating ectopic pregnancies [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Healthcare providers should remain alert to the possibility that a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion could have an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy because some of the expected symptoms experienced with a medical abortion (abdominal pain, uterine bleeding) may be similar to those of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an ectopic pregnancy may have been missed even if the patient underwent ultrasonography prior to being prescribed Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg. Patients who became pregnant with an IUD in place should be assessed for ectopic pregnancy. 5.5 Rhesus Immunization The use of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg is assumed to require the same preventive measures as those taken prior to and during surgical abortion to prevent rhesus immunization."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections: Infection and sepsis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Uterine bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions (>15%) are nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GenBioPro, Inc. at 1-855-643-3463 or medical@genbiopro.com or www.MIFEINFO.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Information presented on common adverse reactions relies solely on data from US studies, because rates reported in non-US studies were markedly lower and are not likely generalizable to the US population. In three US clinical studies totaling 1,248 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24-48 hours later by misoprostol 800mcg buccally, women reported adverse reactions in diaries and in interviews at the follow-up visit. These studies enrolled generally healthy women of reproductive age without contraindications to mifepristone or misoprostol use according to the Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg product label.Gestational age was assessed prior to study enrollment using the date of the woman's last menstrual period, clinical evaluation, and/or ultrasound examination. About 85% of patients report at least one adverse reaction following administration of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol, and many can be expected to report more than one such reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>15%) were nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness (see Table 1). The frequency of adverse reactions varies between studies and may be dependent on many factors including the patient population and gestational age. Abdominal pain/cramping is expected in all medical abortion patients and its incidence is not reported in clinical studies. Treatment with Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol is designed to induce uterine bleeding and cramping to cause termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. Uterine bleeding and cramping are expected consequences of the action of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol as used in the treatment procedure. Most patients can expect bleeding more heavily than they do during a heavy menstrual period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in US clinical studies with incidence >15% of women. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in Women Following Administration of Mifepristone (oral) and Misoprostol (buccal) in US Clinical Studies Adverse Reaction # US studies Number of Evaluable Women Range of frequency (%) Upper Gestational Age of Studies Reporting Outcome Nausea 3 1,248 51-75% 70 days Weakness 2 630 55-58% 63 days Fever/chills 1 414 48% 63 days Vomiting 3 1,248 37-48% 70 days Headache 2 630 41-44% 63 days Diarrhea 3 1,248 18-43% 70 days Dizziness 2 630 39-41% 63 days One study provided gestational-age stratified adverse reaction rates for women who were 57-63 and 64-70 days; there was little difference in frequency of the reported common adverse reactions by gestational age. Information on serious adverse reactions was reported in six US and four non-US clinical studies, totaling 30,966 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200mg orally followed 24-48 hours later by misoprostol 800mcg buccally. Serious adverse reaction rates were similar between US and non-US studies, so rates from both US and non-US studies are presented. In the US studies, one studied women through 56 days gestation, four through 63 days gestation, and one through 70 days gestation, while in the non-US studies, two studied women through 63 days gestation, and two through 70 days gestation. Serious adverse reactions were reported in <0.5% of women. Information from the US and non-US studies is presented in Table 2.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inducers can lower mifepristone concentrations. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase mifepristone concentrations. Use with caution. ( 7.2 ) CYP3A4 substrate concentrations can be increased. Caution with coadministration of substrates with narrow therapeutic margin. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Drugs that May Reduce Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg Exposure (Effect of CYP 3A4 Inducers on Mifepristone tablets, 200mg) CYP450 3A4 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of mifepristone. CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, dexamethasone, St. John's Wort, and certain anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) may induce mifepristone metabolism (lowering serum concentrations of mifepristone). Whether this action has an impact on the efficacy of the dose regimen is unknown. Refer to the follow-up assessment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] to verify that treatment has been successful. 7.2 Drugs that May Increase Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg Exposure (Effect of CYP 3A4 Inhibitors on Mifepristone tablets, 200mg) Although specific drug or food interactions with mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of this drug's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that ketoconazole, itraconazole erythromycin, and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum concentrations of mifepristone). Mifepristone tablets, 200mg should be used with caution in patients currently or recently treated with CYP 3A4 inhibitors. 7.3 Effects of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg on Other Drugs (Effect of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg on CYP 3A4Substrates) Based on in vitro inhibition information, coadministration of mifepristone may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates. Due to the slow elimination of mifepristone from the body, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when mifepristone is administered with drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic range."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Risk of fetal malformations in ongoing pregnancy if not terminated is unknown. ( 8.1 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION, Medication Guide 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mifepristone is indicated, in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation. Risks to pregnant patients are discussed throughout the labeling. Refer to misoprostol labeling for risks to pregnant patients with the use of misoprostol. The risk of adverse developmental outcomes with a continued pregnancy after a failed pregnancy termination with Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol is unknown; however, the process of a failed pregnancy termination could disrupt normal embryo-fetal development and result in adverse developmental effects. Birth defects have been reported with a continued pregnancy after a failed pregnancy termination with Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol. In animal reproduction studies, increased fetal losses were observed in mice, rats, and rabbits and skull deformities were observed in rabbits with administration of mifepristone at doses lower than the human exposure level based on body surface area. Data Animal Data In teratology studies in mice, rats and rabbits at doses of 0.25 to 4.0mg/kg (less than 1/100 to approximately 1/3 the human exposure based on body surface area), because of the antiprogestational activity of mifepristone, fetal losses were much higher than in control animals. Skull deformities were detected in rabbit studies at approximately 1/6 the human exposure, although no teratogenic effects of mifepristone have been observed to date in rats or mice. These deformities were most likely due to the mechanical effects of uterine contractions resulting from inhibition of progesterone action. 8.2 Lactation Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg is present in human milk. Limited data demonstrate undetectable to low levels of the drug in human milk with the relative (weight-adjusted) infant dose 0.5% or less as compared to maternal dosing. There is no information on the effects of Mifepristone tablets, 200 use of misoprostol. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg have been established in pregnant females. Data from a clinical study of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg that included a subset of 322 females under age 17 demonstrated a safety and efficacy profile similar to that observed in adults."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The anti-progestational activity of mifepristone results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone, resulting in effects on the uterus and cervix that, when combined with misoprostol, result in termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Use of Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg in a regimen with misoprostol disrupts pregnancy by causing decidual necrosis, myometrial contractions, and cervical softening, leading to the expulsion of the products of conception. Doses of 1mg/kg or greater of mifepristone have been shown to antagonize the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone in women. Antiglucocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity: Mifepristone also exhibits antiglucocorticoid and weak antiandrogenic activity. The activity of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in rats was inhibited following doses of 10 to 25 mg/kg of mifepristone. Doses of 4.5mg/kg or greater in human beings resulted in a compensatory elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. Antiandrogenic activity was observed in rats following repeated administration of doses from 10 to 100 mg/kg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Mifepristone is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion with non-linear pharmacokinetics for C max after single oral doses of 200 mg and 600 mg in healthy subjects. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg mifepristone oral dose in females of childbearing age is 69%. Following oral administration of a single dose of 600mg, mifepristone is rapidly absorbed, with a peak plasma concentration of 1.98 \u00b1 1.0mg/L occurring approximately 90 minutes after ingestion. Following oral administration of a single dose of 200 mg in healthy men (n=8), mean C max was1.77 \u00b1 0.7 mg/L occurring approximately 45 minutes after ingestion. Mean AUC0-\u221e was 25.8\u00b1 6.2 mg*hr/L. Distribution Mifepristone is 98% bound to plasma proteins, albumin, and 1-acid glycoprotein. Binding to the latter protein is saturable, and the drug displays nonlinear kinetics with respect to plasma concentration and clearance. Elimination Following a distribution phase, elimination of mifepristone is slow at first (50% eliminated between 12 and 72 hours) and then becomes more rapid with a terminal elimination half-life of 18 hours. Metabolism Metabolism of mifepristone is primarily via pathways involving N-demethylation and terminal hydroxylation of the 17-propynyl chain. In vitro studies have shown that CYP450 3A4 is primarily responsible for the metabolism. The three major metabolites identified in humans are: (1) RU 42 633, the most widely found in plasma, is the N-monodemethylated metabolite; (2) RU 42 848, which results from the loss of two methyl groups from the 4-dimethylaminophenyl in position 11\u00df; and (3) RU 42 698, which results from terminal hydroxylation of the 17-propynyl chain. Excretion By 11 days after a 600mg dose of tritiated compound, 83% of the drug has been accounted for by the feces and 9% by the urine. Serum concentrations are undetectable by 11 days. Specific Populations The effects of age, hepatic disease and renal disease on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of mifepristone have not been investigated."

Mutagenesis Results from studies conducted in vitro and in animals have revealed no genotoxic potential for mifepristone. Among the tests carried out were: Ames test with and without metabolic activation; gene conversion test in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 cells; forward mutation in Schizosaccharomyces pompe P1 cells; induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured HeLa cells; induction of chromosome aberrations in CHO cells; in vitro test for gene mutation in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells; and micronucleus test in mice. Impairment of Fertility In rats, administration of 0.3mg/kg mifepristone per day caused severe disruption of the estrus cycles for the three weeks of the treatment period. Following resumption of the estrus cycle, animals were mated and no effects on reproductive performance were observed."

The pregnancy is likely to be passed from your uterus within 2 to 24 hours after taking Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol. When the pregnancy is passed from the uterus, you will have bleeding and cramping that will likely be heavier than your usual period. About 2 to 7 out of 100 women taking Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg will need a surgical procedure because the pregnancy did not completely pass from the uterus or to stop bleeding. Who should not take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg? Some patients should not take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg. Do not take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg if you: Have a pregnancy that is more than 70 days (10 weeks). Your healthcare provider may do a clinical examination, an ultrasound examination, or other testing to determine how far along you are in pregnancy. Are using an IUD (intrauterine device or system). It must be taken out before you take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg. Have been told by your healthcare provider that you have a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Have problems with your adrenal glands (chronic adrenal failure). Take a medicine to thin your blood. Have a bleeding problem. Have porphyria. Take certain steroid medicines. Are allergic to mifepristone, misoprostol, or medicines that contain misoprostol, such as Cytotec or Arthrotec. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure about all your medical conditions before taking this medicine to find out if you can take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg.

The effect of the Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol regimen on the breastfed infant or on milk production is unknown. are taking medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and certain other medicines may affect each other if they are used together. This can cause side effects. How should I take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg? Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg will be given to you by a healthcare provider or pharmacy. You and your healthcare provider will plan the most appropriate location for you to take the misoprostol, because it may cause bleeding, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms that usually begin within 2 to 24 hours after taking it. Most women will pass the pregnancy within 2 to 24 hours after taking the misoprostol tablets. Follow the instruction below on how to take Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol: Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg (1 tablet) orally + misoprostol (4 tablets) buccally Day 1: Take 1 Mifepristone 200 mg tablet by mouth. 24 to 48 hours after taking Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg: Take 4 misoprostol tablets by placing 2 misoprostol tablets in each cheek pouch (the area between your teeth and cheek - see Figure A) for 30 minutes and then swallow anything left over with a drink of water or another liquid. The medicines may not work as well if you take misoprostol sooner than 24 hours after Mifepristone tablets, 200mg or later than 48 hours after Mifepristone tablets, 200mg. Misoprostol often causes cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Your healthcare provider may send you home with medicines for these symptoms.

If your pregnancy has ended, but not yet completely passed from your uterus, your provider will talk with you about other choices you have, including waiting, taking another dose of misoprostol, or having surgical procedure to empty your uterus. When should I begin birth control? You can become pregnant again right after your pregnancy ends. If you do not want to become pregnant again, start using birth control as soon as your pregnancy ends or before you start having sexual intercourse again. What should I avoid while taking Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg and misoprostol? Do not take any other prescription or over-the-counter medicines (including herbal medicines or supplements) at any time during the treatment period without first asking your healthcare provider about them because they may interfere with the treatment.
