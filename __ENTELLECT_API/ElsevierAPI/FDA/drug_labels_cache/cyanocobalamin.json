      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5 to 7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test ( Schilling Test )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder ofthe patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered byintramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption : Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similarto that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Vitamin B12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12 is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see DRUG INTERACTIONS), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12 absorption test (SCHILLING TEST)."

    "warnings": [
      "Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "General Precautions: Vitamin B12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12 regularly. The need for vitamin B12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test The flushing dose is 1000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION: Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. Structural Formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test ( Schilling test )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Avoid using the intravenous route. Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine. Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin; sodium chloride 0.9%; benzyl alcohol 1.5%; Water for Injection q.s.; Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment if necessary (4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark, red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline, red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The Vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The structural formula is represented below: Molecular Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of Vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral Vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal ''Gasping Syndrome'' in premature infants."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for Vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Contains no more than 57 mcg/L of aluminum. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5 th to 7 th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug and Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and Vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than two weeks may produce malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, Vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.50%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid are present as buffer. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions: Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin; sodium chloride 0.9%; benzyl alcohol 1.5%; Water for Injection q.s.; Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment if necessary (4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark, red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline, red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The Vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The structural formula is represented below: Molecular Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of Vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral Vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal ''Gasping Syndrome'' in premature infants."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for Vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Contains no more than 57 mcg/L of aluminum. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5 th to 7 th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug and Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and Vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than two weeks may produce malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, Vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

Pernicious Anemia Parenteral Vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for six or seven days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every three to four days for another two to three weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5 to 7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin Injection is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of Cyanocobalamin Injection. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin; sodium chloride 0.9%; benzyl alcohol 1.5%; Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment if necessary (4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark, red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline, red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The Vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The structural formula is represented below: structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of Vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Patients with early Leber\u2019s disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral Vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \u2018\u2018Gasping Syndrome\u2019\u2019 in premature infants."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for Vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5th to 7th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and Vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than two weeks may produce malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C -Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, Vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of Vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation . Pediatric Use Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council.",

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "WARNINGS: Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Precautions: Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy:Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection (vitamin B12) is a sterile solution of Cyanocobalamin. Each mL contains Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg, sodium chloride 9 mg and benzyl alcohol 0.015 mL in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C63H88CoN14O14P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39.

Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions: Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. If patients are to start Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B 12 to patients suspected of cyanocobalamin hypersensitivity. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Masking of Folate Deficiency with Vitamin B 12 Use: Doses of vitamin B 12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficient megaloblastic anemia and may therefore mask a previously unrecognized folate deficiency. Assess both vitamin B 12 and folate levels prior to initiating therapy with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray or with folic acid. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypokalemia and Thrombocytosis Due to Intense Treatment of Megaloblastic Anemia: Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia that is treated intensely with vitamin B 12 . Monitor serum potassium levels and platelet count during therapy. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Unmasking of Polycythemia Vera: Vitamin B 12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray may unmask this condition. Patients exhibiting clinical or hematologic response consistent with polycythemia vera should be referred for further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Severe Optic Atrophy in Patients with Leber\u2019s Disease Patients with early Leber\u2019s disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with vitamin B 12 suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Cyanocobalamin products, including Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray, is not recommended for use in patients with Leber\u2019s optic atrophy. For patients with Leber\u2019s disease requiring vitamin B 12 , consider alternative therapy (e.g., hydroxocobalamin) for B 12 supplementation. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. If patients are to start Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B 12 to patients suspected of cyanocobalamin hypersensitivity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.3 Masking of Folate Deficiency with Vitamin B 12 Use Doses of vitamin B 12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficient megaloblastic anemia and may therefore mask a previously unrecognized folate deficiency. Vitamin B 12 is not a substitute for folic acid [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Assess both vitamin B 12 and folate levels prior to initiating therapy with vitamin B 12 , including Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray, or with folic acid [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.4 Hypokalemia and Thrombocytosis Due to Intense Treatment of Megaloblastic Anemia Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia that is treated intensely with vitamin B 12 . Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis can occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic anemia to normal erythropoiesis with vitamin B 12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.5 Unmasking of Polycythemia Vera Vitamin B 12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B 12 may unmask this condition. Patients exhibiting clinical or hematologic response consistent with polycythemia vera should be referred for further evaluation."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B 12 . The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.35%. The molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 1355.38 and the following structural formula: Figure 1. Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray Chemical Structure Cyanocobalamin occurs as dark red crystals or orthorhombic needles or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly to moderately soluble in water (1:80). Its pharmacologic activity is destroyed by heavy metals (iron) and strong oxidizing or reducing agents (vitamin C), but not by autoclaving for short periods of time (15-20 minutes) at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray is a solution of cyanocobalamin, USP (vitamin B 12 ) for administration as a spray to the nasal mucosa. Each unit dose device of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray contains 0.125 mL of a 500 mcg/0.1 mL solution of cyanocobalamin with benzalkonium chloride in purified water, citric acid, glycerin and sodium citrate. The spray solution has a pH between 4.5 and 5.5. Each spray delivers an average of 500 mcg of cyanocobalamin per actuation. chemical structure image"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vitamin B 12 can be converted to coenzyme B 12 in tissues, and as such is essential for conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of coenzyme B 12 , tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from its inactive storage form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and a functional folate deficiency occurs. Vitamin B 12 also may be involved in maintaining sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced form required by many SH-activated enzyme systems. Through these reactions, vitamin B 12 is associated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Parenteral (intramuscular) administration of vitamin B 12 completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and GI symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency; the degree of improvement in neurologic symptoms depends on the duration and severity of the lesions, although progression of the lesions is immediately arrested. In pernicious anemia patients, once weekly intranasal dosing with 500 mcg B 12 gel resulted in a consistent increase in pre-dose serum B 12 levels during one month of treatment (p < 0.003) above that seen one month after 100 mcg intramuscular dose (Figure 2). Figure 2. Vitamin B 12 Serum Trough Levels After Intramuscular Solution (IM) of 100 mcg and Nasal Gel (IN) Administration of 500 mcg Cyanocobalamin After Weekly Doses. figure-2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. A three way crossover study in 25 fasting healthy subjects was conducted to compare the bioavailability of the B 12 nasal spray to the B 12 nasal gel and to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the nasal formulations as compared to the intramuscular injection. The peak concentrations after administration of intranasal spray were reached in 1.25 +/- 1.9 hours. The mean peak plasma concentration (C max ) of B 12 , obtained after baseline correction, following administration of intranasal spray were 748 +/-549 pg/mL. The bioavailability of the B 12 nasal spray was found to be 10% less than the B 12 nasal gel. Distribution In the blood, B 12 is bound to transcobalamin II, a specific B-globulin carrier protein, and is distributed and stored primarily in the liver and bone marrow. Elimination About 3-8 mcg of B 12 is secreted into the GI tract daily via the bile and undergoes some enterohepatic recycling; in normal subjects with sufficient intrinsic factor, all but about 1 mcg is reabsorbed. When B 12 is administered in doses which saturate the binding capacity of plasma proteins and the liver, the unbound B 12 is rapidly eliminated in the urine. Retention of B 12 in the body is dose-dependent. About 80-90% of an intramuscular dose up to 50 mcg is retained in the body; this percentage drops to 55% for a 100 mcg dose, and decreases to 15% when a 1000 mcg dose is given."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5 to 7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test ( Schilling Test )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C63H88CoN14O14P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. STRUCTURE"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12 is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see PRECAUTIONS- Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12 absorption test ( DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION- Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions: Vitamin B12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12 regularly. The need for vitamin B12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin.

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative and Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12 is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Vitamin B12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12 regularly. The need for vitamin B12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test The flushing dose is 1000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

Pernicious Anemia Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test The flushing dose is 1000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin; sodium chloride 0.9%; benzyl alcohol 1.5%; Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment if necessary (4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark, red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline, red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The Vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The structural formula is represented below: structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of Vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Patients with early Leber\u2019s disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral Vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \u2018\u2018Gasping Syndrome\u2019\u2019 in premature infants."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for Vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5th to 7th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and Vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than two weeks may produce malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin.

Pernicious Anemia Parenteral Vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient\u2019s life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for six or seven days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every three to four days for another two to three weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients With Normal Intestinal Absorption Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling test The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

      "DESCRIPTION: Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Sensitivity to cobalt and/or vitamin B 12 is a contraindication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Precautions : Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients : Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests : During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility : Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers : Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "WARNINGS: Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

      "PRECAUTIONS: General Precautions : Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients : Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests : During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility : Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers : Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time."

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

      "DESCRIPTION: Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. Structural Formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test ( Schilling test )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Precautions: Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.50%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid are present as buffer. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39. The structural formula is represented below. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions: Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5 to 7.0). Cyanocobalamin, USP appears as red to purplish red, crystalline powder or small crystals. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: \u2022 Addisonian (pernicious) anemia \u2022 Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy \u2022 Fish tapeworm infestation \u2022 Malignancy of pancreas or bowel \u2022 Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin injection is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy Fish tapeworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue.Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervoussystem and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions : Vitamin B12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented withfolic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. Information for Patients : Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthlyinjections of vitamin B12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and indevelopment of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia butallow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12.Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12 regularly. The need for vitamin B12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants ofvegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Laboratory Tests : During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from thefifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeatdeterminations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility : Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenicpotential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been donein pregnant women. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers : Vitamin B12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science- National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use : Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption : Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similarto that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1,000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1,000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride USP, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol NF, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Dibasic Sodium Phosphate (Heptahydrate) USP 0.05% is present as a buffering agent. Hydrochloric acid NF and/or sodium hydroxide NF may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as crystals or deep red colored, odorless crystalline powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.35%. The molecular weight is 1355.4.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels. ( 2.1 ) The recommended initial dose is one spray (500 mcg) in one nostril once weekly. ( 2.2 ) Administer at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids. ( 2.2 ) Monitor serum B12 levels periodically. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months. ( 2.3 ) If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy (e.g., intramuscular or subcutaneous vitamin B12 therapy). ( 2.3 ) See Full Prescribing Information to see what other therapies should be administered with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Testing and Other Considerations Prior to Dosing Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B 12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [ see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to use of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended initial dose of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray is one spray (500 mcg) administered in ONE nostril once weekly. Administer Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided. 2.3 Monitoring, Dosage Modifications, and Treatment Duration Monitoring for Response and Safety Monitor serum B 12 levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B 12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Dosage Modifications If serum levels of B 12 decline after one month of treatment with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B 12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B 12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy (e.g., intramuscular or subcutaneous vitamin B 12 therapy). Treatment Duration In patients whose underlying cause of vitamin B 12 deficiency has been corrected and are deemed no longer at risk for vitamin B 12 deficiency, discontinue Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray. The safety and effectiveness of continued long-term use in these individuals has not been established. In patients with pernicious anemia, continue appropriate vitamin B 12 treatment indefinitely. 2.4 Administration of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray with Other Therapy Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray should be administered with other therapy(ies) in: Patients with concurrent folate and vitamin B12 deficiency: Administer folic acid in addition to Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray Patients with concurrent iron and vitamin B12 deficiency: Administer iron in addition to Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray Patients with correctible causes of vitamin B12 deficiency: Consider measures to treat the underlying condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in addition to treatment with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe Optic Atrophy in Patients with Leber's Disease : Patients with early Leber's disease who were treated with vitamin B12 suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in these patients ( 5.1 ) Anaphylactic Reactions : Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. If patients are to start Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 to patients suspected of cyanocobalamin hypersensitivity. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Masking of Folate Deficiency with Vitamin B12 Use : Doses of vitamin B12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficient megaloblastic anemia and may therefore mask a previously unrecognized folate deficiency. Assess both vitamin B12 and folate levels prior to initiating therapy with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray or with folic acid. ( 5.3 ) Hypokalemia and Thrombocytosis Due to Intense Treatment of Megaloblastic Anemia : Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia that is treated intensely with vitamin B12. Monitor serum potassium levels and platelet count during therapy. ( 5.4 ) Unmasking of Polycythemia Vera : Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray may unmask this condition. Patients exhibiting clinical or hematologic response consistent with polycythemia vera should be referred for further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Severe Optic Atrophy in Patients with Leber\u2019s Disease Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with vitamin B12 suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Cyanocobalamin products, including Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray, is not recommended for use in patients with Leber's optic atrophy. For patients with Leber's disease requiring vitamin B12, consider alternative therapy (e.g., hydroxocobalamin) for B12 supplementation. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. If patients are to start Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 to patients suspected of cyanocobalamin hypersensitivity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.3 Masking of Folate Deficiency with Vitamin B12 Use Doses of vitamin B12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficient megaloblastic anemia and may therefore mask a previously unrecognized folate deficiency. Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Assess both vitamin B12 and folate levels prior to initiating therapy with vitamin B12, including Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray, or with folic acid [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.4 Hypokalemia and Thrombocytosis Due to Intense Treatment of Megaloblastic Anemia Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia that is treated intensely with vitamin B12. Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis can occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic anemia to normal erythropoiesis with vitamin B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.5 Unmasking of Polycythemia Vera Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition. Patients exhibiting clinical or hematologic response consistent with polycythemia vera should be referred for further evaluation."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4.35%. The molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 1355.38 and the following structural formula: Figure 1. Cyanocobalamin Chemical Structure Cyanocobalamin occurs as red to purplish red crystalline powder or small crystals. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly to moderately soluble in water (1:80). Its pharmacologic activity is destroyed by heavy metals (iron) and strong oxidizing or reducing agents (vitamin C), but not by autoclaving for short periods of time (15-20 minutes) at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. Cyanocobalamin Nasal Spray is a solution of cyanocobalamin, USP (vitamin B 12 ) for administration as a spray to the nasal mucosa.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vitamin B 12 can be converted to coenzyme B 12 in tissues, and as such is essential for conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of coenzyme B 12 , tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from its inactive storage form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and a functional folate deficiency occurs. Vitamin B 12 also may be involved in maintaining sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced form required by many SH-activated enzyme systems. Through these reactions, vitamin B12 is associated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Parenteral (intramuscular) administration of vitamin B 12 completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and GI symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency; the degree of improvement in neurologic symptoms depends on the duration and severity of the lesions, although progression of the lesions is immediately arrested. In pernicious anemia patients, once weekly intranasal dosing with 500 mcg B12 gel resulted in a consistent increase in pre-dose serum B12 levels during one month of treatment (p < 0.003) above that seen one month after 100 mcg intramuscular dose (Figure 2). Figure 2. Vitamin B12 Serum Trough Levels After Intramuscular Solution (IM) of 100 mcg and Nasal Gel (IN) Administration of 500 mcg Cyanocobalamin After Weekly Doses. 12.4 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. A three way crossover study in 25 fasting healthy subjects was conducted to compare the bioavailability of the B12 nasal spray to the B12 nasal gel and to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the nasal formulations as compared to the intramuscular injection. The peak concentrations after administration of intranasal spray were reached in 1.25 +/ 1.9 hours. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of B12, obtained after baseline correction, following administration of intranasal spray were 748 +/-549 pg/mL. The bioavailability of the B12 nasal spray was found to be 10% less than the B12 nasal gel. Distribution In the blood, B12 is bound to transcobalamin II, a specific B-globulin carrier protein, and is distributed and stored primarily in the liver and bone marrow. Elimination About 3-8 mcg of B12 is secreted into the GI tract daily via the bile and undergoes some enterohepatic recycling; in normal subjects with sufficient intrinsic factor, all but about 1 mcg is reabsorbed. When B12 is administered in doses which saturate the binding capacity of plasma proteins and the liver, the unbound B12 is rapidly eliminated in the urine. Retention of B12 in the body is dose-dependent. About 80-90% of an intramuscular dose up to 50 mcg is retained in the body; this percentage drops to 55% for a 100 mcg dose, and decreases to 15% when a 1000 mcg dose is given. Graph"

      "DESCRIPTION Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin. Each vial also contains Sodium Chloride, 0.9%. Benzyl Alcohol, 1.5%, is present as a preservative. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH (range 4.5-7.0). Cyanocobalamin appears as red crystalline or small crystals. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121\u00b0C. The vitamin B 12 coenzymes are very unstable in light. The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C 63 H 88 CoN 14 O 14 P. The cobalt content is 4.34%.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vitamin B 12 is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B 12 deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including glutren enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total for partial gastrectomy. Fish taprworm infestation Malignancy of pancreas or bowel Folic acid deficiency It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions ), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin. Requirements of vitamin B 12 in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B 12 absorption test (Schilling test)."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy. Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely. Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B 12 administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions: Vitamin B 12 deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B 12 , irreversible damage will result. Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis. InformationforPatients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B 12 for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B 12 , because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration. A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B 12 . Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B 12 regularly. The need for vitamin B 12 is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time. Contains no more than 625 mcg/L of aluminum. Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary. Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow. Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B 12 diagnostic blood assays. Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B 12 . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, ImpairmentofFertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B 12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B 12 is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B 12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation. Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council."

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B 12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed. Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B 12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated. SchillingTest: The flushing dose is 1000 mcg. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."
