      "WARNINGS Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy hepatic or renal disease hyperthyroidism coronary heart disease congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias tachycardia hypertension Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer. Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur. Information for Patients Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work.

When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets. There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks (see WARNINGS ) . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data). In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system has not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.5 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 1.8 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing layer of peach-colored polyethylene/polyester film printed with brown ink; (2) a solid matrix drug reservoir layer of silicone adhesive, scopolamine and povidone; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane; and (4) an adhesive formulation of silicone adhesive, povidone and scopolamine. A protective, oversized release liner of fluoropolymer-coated polyester, which covers the adhesive formulation layer, is removed before the system is used. The brown ink contains acrylic polymers, carbon black, iron oxides (red and yellow), polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene wax, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate and triethanolamine. Scopolamine transdermal systems are packaged with an additional piece of protective film covering the system within each pouch. This piece of protective film is removed and discarded at the time of use. Cross section of the system: Scopolamine Structural Formula Cross section of the system"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of scopolamine. The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated. Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system). However, fertility studies in male animals were not performed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage : Motion Sickness: Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV: For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women: Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia: Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision: Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns: Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 7.2 ) Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach: Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3 ) Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test: Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 )] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )] . Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.5 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2 phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film printed with brown ink; (2) a drug adhesive layer of scopolamine, acrylic adhesive and isopropyl myristate; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a drug adhesive layer of scopolamine, acrylic adhesive and isopropyl myristate. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. The brown imprinting ink contains FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, polyamide resin, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene wax, carbon black and quinacridone red pigment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion or dizziness. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe-POL-a-meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \u201cScopolamine 1 mg/3 days\u201d printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable plastic release liner with stipples (See Figure 1). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Tear along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing (disposable release liner with stipples) from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan-colored side of the scopolamine transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from the scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system ? Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children. The Patient Information and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy hepatic or renal disease hyperthyroidism coronary heart disease congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias tachycardia hypertension Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer. Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir \u2013 Mint contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. Information for Patients Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Drug Interactions Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir. There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir is administered to a nursing woman.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal (2.1) : Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness: Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. (2.2) PONV: For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. (2.2) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. (5.1) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. (5.2 , 7.1) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women: Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. (5.3) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. (5.4 , 7.2) Hyperthermia: Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. (5.5) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. (5.6) Blurred Vision: Avoid contact with the eyes. (2.1 , 5.7) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

(7.1) Anticholinergic Drugs: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. (7.2) Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach: Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. (7.3) Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test: Discontinue use of scopolamine 10 days prior to testing. (7.4) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Either scopolamine or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] , intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine 10 days prior to testing."

(5.2 , 8.5) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. (5.2 , 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and (Data)] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ] . Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation.

These withdrawal symptoms indicate that scopolamine, like other anticholinergic drugs, may produce physical dependence. The onset of these symptoms, generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed, can be severe and may require medical intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.16 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 1.55 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, pigmented polyethylene/polyester film printed with brown ink; (2) a solid matrix drug reservoir layer of silicone adhesive, scopolamine, povidone and dimethicone; (3) a microporous monolayer polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an adhesive formulation of silicone adhesive, povidone, dimethicone and scopolamine. A protective, oversized release liner of fluoropolymer-coated polyester, which covers the adhesive formulation layer, is removed before the system is used.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function."

The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated. Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system).

Scopolamine was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information and Instructions for Use ). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. A round patch, consisting of a tan backing film flood printed with \u201cScopolamine 1 mg/3 days\u201d, a layer of white to off-white adhesive, a white to off-white polypropylene membrane, and a layer of white to off-white adhesive protected with removable, transparent, dimpled and oversized release liner (See Figure 1). Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2). Open and remove the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system from the pouch (See Figure 3). Do not touch the white to off-white adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness : Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV : For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section : Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow, or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction), and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions : Monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions (drowsiness, dizziness, or disorientations). ( 7.1 ) Anticholinergic Drugs: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. ( 7.2 ) Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach : Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3) Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test: Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics, and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity, remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.28 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, light mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and polyisobutylene; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of mineral oil, polyisobutylene, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion, or dizziness.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \"Scopolamine 1 mg/3 days\" printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor's instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1 ). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain, or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2 ). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3 ). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4 ). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan-colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5 ). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets, or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system?

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women: Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) Blurred Vision: Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns: Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized film. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data) . In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.28 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.1 mm thick, 2.13 cm 2 film with two layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing layer composed of a tan colored, pigmented, flexible film consisting of a polyethylene outer layer and a metalized polyester inner layer; (2) an adhesive matrix of the drug substance scopolamine, acrylic adhesive solution, isopropyl myristate, and oleyl alcohol. A release liner which protects the adhesive matrix layer during storage should be removed immediately prior to application. Cross section of the system: 1 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women: Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia: Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision: Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. M onitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), , amblyopia hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.237 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.4 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 1.57 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing layer of tan-colored polyethylene/polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, povidone and silicone adhesive; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of scopolamine, povidone and silicone adhesive. A protective, oversized release liner of fluorosilicone-coated polyester, which covers the adhesive formulation layer, is removed before the system is used. Scopolamine transdermal systems are packaged with an additional piece of protective film covering the system within each pouch. This piece of protective film is removed and discarded at the time of use. Cross section of the system: Image Image"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of scopolamine. The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated. Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system). However, fertility studies in male animals were not performed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data). In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated. Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system). However, fertility studies in male animals were not performed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness: Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV: For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women: Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia: Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision: Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns: Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized film. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )] . Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.28 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.1 mm thick, 2.13 cm 2 film with two layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing layer composed of a tan colored, pigmented, flexible film consisting of a polyethylene outer layer and a metalized polyester inner layer; (2) an adhesive matrix of the drug substance scopolamine, acrylic adhesive solution, isopropyl myristate, and oleyl alcohol. A release liner which protects the adhesive matrix layer during storage should be removed immediately prior to application. Cross section of the system: 1 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of scopolamine. The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated. Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system). However, fertility studies in male animals were not performed."

Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe pol' a meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \u201cScopolamine 1 mg/3 days\u201d printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing film with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2). 3. Remove the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system from the clear disposable release liner (See Figure 3). Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands. 4. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 4). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system? Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system. Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 )] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data). In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies. 14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients."

      "Instructions for Use INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe pol\u2019 a meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: \u2022 Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \u201cSCOP 1 mg/3 days\u201d printed on it. \u2022 Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. \u2022 Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: \u2022 Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. \u2022 If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: \u2022 Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. \u2022 Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5). Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system? \u2022 Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. \u2022 Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. \u2022 Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system. Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children. The Medication Guide and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Revised: April 2019"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): \u2022 Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. \u2022 Only wear one transdermal system at a time. \u2022 Do not cut the transdermal system. \u2022 Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. \u2022 Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. \u2022 Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage : \u2022 Motion Sickness: Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 PONV: For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions \u2022 Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. \u2022 Only wear one transdermal system at any time. \u2022 Do not cut the transdermal system. \u2022 Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). \u2022 After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . \u2022 If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. \u2022 Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. \u2022 Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. \u2022 Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions : Monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions (drowsiness, dizziness or disorientations). ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Drugs : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach : Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test : Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 )] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "Instructions for Use INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe pol\u2019 a meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: \u2022 Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \u201cSCOP 1 mg/3 days\u201d printed on it. \u2022 Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. \u2022 Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: \u2022 Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. \u2022 If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: \u2022 Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. \u2022 Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system? \u2022 Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. \u2022 Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. \u2022 Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system. Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness : Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV : For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days.

Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction), and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity, remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.28 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, light mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and polyisobutylene; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of mineral oil, polyisobutylene, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar.

After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion, or dizziness. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility and Urinary Retention Instruct patients to remove the transdermal system if they develop symptoms of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting) or any difficulties in urinating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Hyperthermia Inform patients that scopolamine transdermal system can increase body temperature and reduce sweating, which may result in hyperthermia and be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these effects. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, remove the transdermal system, and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist after removal of the transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Inform patients that if they remove the scopolamine transdermal system after several days of use, withdrawal symptoms may occur and to seek immediate medical care if they develop severe symptoms after removing scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Blurred Vision Inform patients that temporary dilation of the pupils and blurred vision may occur if scopolamine transdermal system comes in contact with the eyes. Instruct patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . MRI Skin Burns Instruct patients to remove the scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow, or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction), and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia, and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia, and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity, remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.28 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, light mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and polyisobutylene; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of mineral oil, polyisobutylene, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe-POL-a-meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \"Scopolamine 1 mg/3 days\" printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor's instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1 ). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain, or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2 ). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3 ). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4 ). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan-colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5 ). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets, or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system? Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system. Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children. The Patient Information and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 4/2024"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

( 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Drugs : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach : Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test : Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] , intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data ) . In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] . Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.5 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (\u03b1S)-\u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)benzeneacetic acid (1\u03b1,2\u03b2,4\u03b2,5\u03b1,7\u03b2)-9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]non-7-yl ester. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 1.8 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing layer of peach-colored polyethylene/polyester film printed with brown ink; (2) a solid matrix drug reservoir layer of silicone adhesive, scopolamine and povidone; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane; and (4) an adhesive formulation of silicone adhesive, povidone and scopolamine. A protective, oversized release liner of fluoropolymer-coated polyester, which covers the adhesive formulation layer, is removed before the system is used. The brown ink contains acrylic polymers, carbon black, iron oxides (red and yellow), polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene wax, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate and triethanolamine. Scopolamine transdermal systems are packaged with an additional piece of protective film covering the system within each pouch. This piece of protective film is removed and discarded at the time of use. Cross section of the system: Scopolamine Structural Formula Cross section of the system"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness : Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV : For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section : Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow, or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction), and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics, and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity, remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.28 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, light mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and polyisobutylene; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of mineral oil, polyisobutylene, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system: Chemical Structure Image"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion, or dizziness. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility and Urinary Retention Instruct patients to remove the transdermal system if they develop symptoms of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting) or any difficulties in urinating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Hyperthermia Inform patients that scopolamine transdermal system can increase body temperature and reduce sweating, which may result in hyperthermia and be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these effects. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, remove the transdermal system, and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist after removal of the transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Scopolamine (skoe-POL-a-meen) Transdermal System Read this Instructions for Use before you start using scopolamine transdermal system and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \"Scopolamine 1 mg/3 days\" printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor's instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1 ). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain, or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2 ). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3 ). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4 ). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan-colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5 ). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets, or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system? Store scopolamine transdermal system at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) until you are ready to use it. Store scopolamine transdermal system in an upright position. Do not bend or roll scopolamine transdermal system. Keep scopolamine transdermal system and all medicines out of reach of children. The Patient Information and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 06/2025 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Drugs : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach : Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test : Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 )] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data). In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms : Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction) and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 5.2 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Data] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system: structure cross-section"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] : \u2022 Only wear one transdermal system at any time. \u2022 Do not cut the transdermal system. \u2022 Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. \u2022 After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. \u2022 If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. \u2022 Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. \u2022 Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. \u2022 Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions \u2022 Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. \u2022 Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. \u2022 Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion or dizziness. \u2022 Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility and Urinary Retention Instruct patients to remove the transdermal system if they develop symptoms of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting) or any difficulties in urinating [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Hyperthermia Inform patients that scopolamine transdermal system can increase body temperature and reduce sweating, which may result in hyperthermia and be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these effects. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, remove the transdermal system, and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist after removal of the transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Inform patients that if they remove the scopolamine transdermal system after several days of use, withdrawal symptoms may occur and to seek immediate medical care if they develop severe symptoms after removing scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Blurred Vision Inform patients that temporary dilation of the pupils and blurred vision may occur if scopolamine transdermal system comes in contact with the eyes. Instruct patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] .

To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: \u2022 Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. \u2022 If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Application and Removal ( 2.1 ): Each scopolamine transdermal system delivers 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at a time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application. Avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system once applied. Upon removal, fold used transdermal system in half with sticky side together, discard to prevent accidental contact or ingestion, and wash the hands and application site with soap and water. Recommended Dosage: Motion Sickness : Apply one transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before antiemetic effect is required for use up to 3 days. If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. ( 2.2 ) PONV : For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear). After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Adult Dosage Motion Sickness Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required \u2013 for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear. PONV For surgeries other than cesarean section : Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions : May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women : Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, patients with impeded urine flow, or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Hyperthermia : Serious adverse reactions have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients, including fatal cases. If symptoms occur, remove the transdermal system, and contact a healthcare provider. ( 5.5 ) Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.6 ) Blurred Vision : Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns : Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or patients with impeded flow of urine (e.g., in diseases of the prostate or urinary bladder neck obstruction), and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 5.5 Hyperthermia Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in adult and pediatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including fatal cases. Anticholinergic agents, including scopolamine, can increase core body temperature and reduce sweating, which may cause further increases in body temperature. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Pediatric and geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these anticholinergic effects on thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider. Symptoms may persist following removal of the used transdermal system as there may be continued systemic absorption of scopolamine through the skin. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ] . 5.6 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.7 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system, do not touch the system while wearing it, and wash hands and the application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.8 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI."

( 6.1 ) PONV (\u2265 3%): dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, agitation, visual impairment, confusion, mydriasis, and pharyngitis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhodes Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-827-0616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Motion Sickness The most common adverse reaction (approximately two thirds) was dry mouth. Less common adverse reactions included drowsiness (less than one sixth), blurred vision, and dilation of the pupils. PONV Common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 3% of patients in PONV clinical trials, are shown in Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions : Monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions (drowsiness, dizziness, or disorientations). ( 7.1 ) Anticholinergic Drugs: Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs. ( 7.2 ) Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach : Monitor for increased or decreased therapeutic effect of the oral drug. ( 7.3) Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test: Discontinue use of scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics, and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ], intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 7.4 Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment due to increased risk of CNS adverse reactions. ( 5.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data ] . Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of scopolamine transdermal system have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of scopolamine, including neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions and drug withdrawal syndrome. Serious adverse reactions of acute psychosis (e.g., disorientation, hallucinations), amblyopia, hyperthermia (including a fatal case), and mydriasis have also been reported in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and drug withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ]. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions of hyperthermia have been reported postmarketing in geriatric patients receiving transdermal scopolamine, including a fatal case. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of disruption in thermoregulation. Advise patients if body temperature increases, or they are not sweating in warm environmental conditions, to remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 8.6 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. In cases of toxicity, remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended. The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal. If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.3 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55 to 7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.28 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, light mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and polyisobutylene; (3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a contact layer formulation of mineral oil, polyisobutylene, isopropyl palmitate, crospovidone, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Administration Instructions Counsel patients on how to apply and remove the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area. After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands. If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear. Once the transdermal system has been affixed, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system, since pressure exerted on it may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Upon removal, fold the used transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others. Wash the hands and application site with soap and water after transdermal system removal. Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma Advise patients with open-angle glaucoma to remove the scopolamine transdermal system immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma, including pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils, blurred vision and/or seeing halos around lights [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or in those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report to their healthcare provider any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. Advise patients to discontinue scopolamine transdermal system and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure. Advise patients, especially elderly patients, that cognitive impairment may occur during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system, especially in those receiving other drugs also associated with CNS effects, and to report to their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as hallucinations, confusion, or dizziness. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility and Urinary Retention Instruct patients to remove the transdermal system if they develop symptoms of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting) or any difficulties in urinating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Hyperthermia Inform patients that scopolamine transdermal system can increase body temperature and reduce sweating, which may result in hyperthermia and be exacerbated by exposure to external heat sources or high environmental temperature. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to these effects.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Information about scopolamine transdermal system: Scopolamine transdermal system is a tan-colored, circle shaped transdermal system (patch) with \"Scopolamine 1 mg/3 days\" printed on it. Wear only one scopolamine transdermal system at any time. Do not cut scopolamine transdermal system. To help prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness: Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to your skin on a hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the activity to prevent nausea and vomiting. If the treatment is needed for longer than 3 days, remove scopolamine transdermal system from the hairless area behind your ear. Get a new scopolamine transdermal system and place it on the hairless area behind your other ear. To help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery: Follow your doctor's instructions about when to apply scopolamine transdermal system before your scheduled surgery. Scopolamine transdermal system should be left in place for 24 hours after surgery. After 24 hours, scopolamine transdermal system should be removed and thrown away. How to use scopolamine transdermal system: Inside the scopolamine transdermal system package, you will find one scopolamine transdermal system. An imprinted, tan backing membrane with a metallic (silver) sticky surface is adhered to a clear, disposable release liner (See Figure 1 ). 1. Select a hairless area of skin behind one of your ears. Avoid areas on your skin that may have cuts, pain, or tenderness. Wipe the area of your skin with a clean, dry tissue. 2. Cut along the dashed line on the scopolamine transdermal system package to open (See Figure 2 ). 3. Remove the clear plastic backing from the tan-colored round scopolamine transdermal system (See Figure 3 ). 4. Do not touch the metallic adhesive (sticky) surface on scopolamine transdermal system with your hands (See Figure 4 ). 5. Apply the metallic adhesive surface of scopolamine transdermal system firmly to the dry area of skin behind your ear. The imprinted, tan-colored side of the transdermal system should be facing up and showing (See Figure 5 ). After placement of scopolamine transdermal system, avoid touching or applying pressure to the transdermal system while it is being worn because applying pressure may cause scopolamine to ooze out at the edge. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after applying scopolamine transdermal system, so that any medicine from scopolamine transdermal system that gets on your hands will not get into your eyes. How to remove scopolamine transdermal system: After removing scopolamine transdermal system, be sure to wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water. Please note that the used scopolamine transdermal system will still contain some of the active ingredient after use. To avoid accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets, or others, fold the used scopolamine transdermal system in half with the sticky side together. Throw away (dispose of) scopolamine transdermal system in the household trash out of the reach of children, pets, or others. How should I store scopolamine transdermal system?
