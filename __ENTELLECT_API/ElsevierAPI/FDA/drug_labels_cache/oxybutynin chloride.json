    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson's disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. (8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician. Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk. Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6\u201315 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

Patients were aged 6\u201315 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The continuous release of oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage. Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Activated charcoal as well as a cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: lactose, mannitol, dextrose, tartaric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, triacetin, black iron oxide, propylene glycol, hypromellose. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2) , Parkinson's disease (5.2) , Myasthenia gravis (5.3) , and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u22655%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. (8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (8.6 , 8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The continuous release of oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage. Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. A cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: black iron oxide, cellulose acetate, colloidal silicon dioxide, dextrose, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tartaric acid, titanium dioxide, triacetin. Structural Formula System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information about the drug product, call Lannett Company Inc at 1-844-834-0530.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

The incidence of dry mouth was dose-related. In addition, the following adverse events were reported by 1 to < 5% of patients using oxybutynin chloride (5 to 20 mg/day) in all studies. Infections and Infestations: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, cystitis, fungal infection; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: fluid retention; Psychiatric Disorders: confusional state; Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia, sinus headache; Eye Disorders: keratoconjunctivitis sicca, eye irritation; Cardiac Disorders: palpitations, sinus arrhythmia; Vascular Disorders: flushing; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal dryness, cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dry throat, sinus congestion, hoarseness, asthma, nasal congestion; Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, abdominal pain, loose stools, flatulence, vomiting, abdominal pain upper, dysphagia, aptyalism, eructation, tongue coated; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: dry skin, pruritis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: back pain, arthralgia, pain in extremity, flank pain; Renal and Urinary Disorders: dysuria, pollakiuria; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: fatigue, edema peripheral, asthenia, pain, thirst, edema; Investigations: blood pressure increased, blood glucose increased, blood pressure decreased; Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: fall. Postmarketing Surveillance Because postmarketing adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse events have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oral oxybutynin chloride: Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, hallucination, memory impairment; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, glaucoma; Cardiac Disorders: tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, chest discomfort; Gastrointestinal Disorders: decreased gastrointestinal motility, frequent bowel movements; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, decreased sweating; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: suppression of lactation; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; rare anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dysphonia.

      "OVERDOSAGE Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Activated charcoal as well as a cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation (e.g., restlessness, tremor, irritability, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations), flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Other symptoms may include hypotension or hypertension, respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u2265 5%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. Product meets USP Dissolution Test 6"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

Mean steady-state (\u00b1SD) R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following administration of total daily Oxybutynin Chloride Tablet dose of 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 mg/kg to 0.53 mg/kg) in children 5-15 years of age. \u2013 Plot represents all available data normalized to the equivalent of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg BID or TID at steady state Food Effects Data in the literature suggests that oxybutynin solution co-administered with food resulted in a slight delay in absorption and an increase in its bioavailability by 25% (n=18).1 Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin.

These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one-fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of the prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one-fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2) Parkinson's disease (5.2) Myasthenia gravis (5.3) Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations; QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

(8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (8.6, 8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician. Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk. Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6\u201315 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: lactose, mannitol, dextrose, tartaric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, triacetin, black iron oxide, propylene glycol, hypromellose. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours (n = 23) Parameters (Units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u22c5h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u22c5h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24 month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u2265 5%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. ( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment.",

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. Product meets USP Dissolution Test 6"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours 2,3,4 . In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment) Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. fig-1 fig-2"

Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. fig-1 fig-2"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6% to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2219h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6% to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ]. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "OVERDOSAGE Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Activated charcoal as well as a cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation (e.g., restlessness, tremor, irritability, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations), flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Other symptoms may include hypotension or hypertension, respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 mg/day to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride tablets (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by greater than or equal to 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by less than 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations; QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders : impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R\u00ad and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1:Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg (0.10 mg/kg to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (greater than 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (greater than 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by greater than or equal to 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and greater than or equal to 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call 1-855-664-7744. Product of INDIA Marketed by: Ajanta Pharma USA Inc.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 mg/day to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride tablets (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by greater than or equal to 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride, USP is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride, USP is 4(diethylamino-but-2-ynyl (RS) 2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy 2 phenyl acetate hydrochloride. The molecular formula of oxybutynin chloride, USP is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride, USP is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 393.95. It is freely soluble in water and in alcohol, very soluble in methanol and in chloroform, soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in ether, very slightly soluble in hexane. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, povidone, hypromellose, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, methacrylic acid copolymer type c, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, ferrosoferric oxide, ferric oxide red (in 10 mg only) and iron oxide yellow (in 5 mg and 15 mg only). The imprinting material contains: shellac glaze, black iron oxide, propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide. Meets USP Dissolution Test 9. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R\u00ad and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1:Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg (0.10 mg/kg to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (greater than 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by greater than or equal to 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and greater than or equal to 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

      "WARNINGS Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years.

      "WARNINGS Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride oral solution, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%). Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 23 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride oral solution (n=12) with total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 22.5 mg (0.26 to 0.75 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2b (for oral solution). The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. image description image description"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride oral solution has been studied in 26 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 30 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride oral solution was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 113 mL to 133 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 143 mL to 165 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 63%. Urodynamic results were consistent with these clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride oral solution was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 192 mL to 294 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 46 cm H 2 O to 37 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 67% to 28%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2, 3, 4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2) , Parkinson\u2019s disease (5.2) , Myasthenia gravis (5.3) , and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy (5.4) . Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u22655%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate-release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate-release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. (8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (8.6, 8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chlorideextended-release tablets on milk production.

Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride, USP is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride, USP is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride, USP is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride, USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: hydrogenated vegetable oil, hypromellose, isopropyl alcohol, lactose monohydrate, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc and triethyl citrate. The 5 mg tablets also contain D&C Red #27 and FD&C Blue #1. The 10 mg tablets also contain FD&C Red #40 and FD&C Yellow #6. Meets USP Dissolution Test 7. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP uses a pH-independent hydrophilic matrix and pH dependent enteric coating to deliver oxybutynin chloride, USP at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP comprises of an inner core made of the drug, rate controlling pH independent polymer and other excipients. The tablet core is then coated with pH dependent enteric coating polymer. When tablets will be exposed to an acidic environment such as the stomach, the drug release will be minimal due to outer enteric coating of the pH dependent polymer. The outer enteric coating upon reaching an environment of pH 5.5 and above will start to dissolve and the polymer in the inner core tablet will hydrate to form a gel layer and the drug releases via diffusion process. 1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady-state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady-state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. 1 Figure 2"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5 and 6 and Figures 3, 4 and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 0 to 33 cm H 2 0, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 0) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation (e.g., restlessness, tremor, irritability, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations), flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Other symptoms may include hypotension or hypertension, respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of 5 mg Oxybutynin Chloride. Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ngh/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ngh/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S\u00ad oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. figure1 figure2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day. Table 3: Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Children Aged 5 to 15 Following Administration of 5 to 20 mg Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets Once Daily (n=19), All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg Once Daily R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin R- Desethyloxybutynin S- Desethyloxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 1.3 \u00b1 0.8 7.8 \u00b1 3.7 4.2 \u00b1 2.3 T max (h) 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 AUC (ng\u2219h/mL) 12.8 \u00b1 7.0 23.7 \u00b1 14.4 125.1 \u00b1 66.7 73.6 \u00b1 47.7 Figure 2: Mean steady state (\u00b1 SD) R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following administration of 5 to 20 mg oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets once daily in children aged 5 to 15. Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for both the tablet and syrup. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 23 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets (n=11) with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg) or oxybutynin chloride syrup (n=12) with total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 22.5 mg (0.26 to 0.75 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2a (for tablet) and Table 2b (for syrup).

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Figure 1 Figure 1"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin Chloride Syrup should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets and oxybutynin chloride syrup were studied in 30 and in 26 children, respectively, in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 0 to 33 cm H 2 0, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 0) from 39% to 20%.

Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2, 3, 4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets and oxybutynin chloride syrup were studied in 30 and in 26 children, respectively, in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 0 to 33 cm H 2 0, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 0) from 39% to 20%.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples.

Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) \u2022 Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) \u2022 Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: o Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2) , o Parkinson\u2019s disease (5.2) , o Myasthenia gravis (5.3) , and o Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy (5.4) . \u2022 Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.5) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u22655%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate-release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate-release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. \u2022 Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) \u2022 Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

(8.4) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (8.6, 8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chlorideextended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chlorideextended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chlorideextended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride, USP is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride, USP is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride, USP is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride, USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: hydrogenated vegetable oil, hypromellose, isopropyl alcohol, lactose monohydrate, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc and triethyl citrate. The 5 mg tablets also contain D&C Red #27 and FD&C Blue #1. The 10 mg tablets also contain FD&C Red #40 and FD&C Yellow #6. Meets USP Dissolution Test 7. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP uses a pH-independent hydrophilic matrix and pH dependent enteric coating to deliver oxybutynin chloride, USP at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP comprises of an inner core made of the drug, rate controlling pH independent polymer and other excipients. The tablet core is then coated with pH dependent enteric coating polymer. When tablets will be exposed to an acidic environment such as the stomach, the drug release will be minimal due to outer enteric coating of the pH dependent polymer. The outer enteric coating upon reaching an environment of pH 5.5 and above will start to dissolve and the polymer in the inner core tablet will hydrate to form a gel layer and the drug releases via diffusion process. 1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady-state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady-state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. 1 Figure 2"

The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. 1 Figure 2"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5 and 6 and Figures 3, 4 and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson's disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: hypromellose, hydrogenated vegetable oil, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, povidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate co-polymer dispersion, triethyl citrate, talc, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol/macrogol, iron oxide yellow non-irradiated, isopropyl alcohol and iron oxide red non-irradiated. The ink contains shellac glaze (modified), black iron oxide non-irradiated, N-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP uses an enteric coated hydrophilic hydrogel matrix to deliver oxybutynin chloride at controlled rate over approximately 24 hours by diffusion mechanism. The system comprises of a core, which contains the drug, rate controlling hydrogel and other excipients. The core is surrounded by a partially or complete pH dependent membrane. Hence, when the drug reaches the acidic medium, in stomach minimal drug release will occur and when it reaches an environment of pH 5.5 and above, the outer membrane will be dissolved exposing the inner core. This inner core will partially hydrate to form a gel layer and the drug release will occur via diffusion mechanism from a gel layer and subsequently through gel erosion. Meets USP Dissolution Method 4. FDA approved acceptance criteria differs from the USP acceptance criteria."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (Cmax and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4 , 5 and 6 , and Figures 3 , 4 and 5 Table 4: Number of Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per Week (Study 1) Study 1 n Oxybutynin ER n Placebo Mean Baseline 34 15.9 16 20.9 Mean (SD) Change from Baseline \u2020 34 -15.8 (8.9) 16 -7.6 (8.6) 95% Confidence Interval for Difference (-13.6, -2.8) * (Oxybutynin ER - Placebo) * The difference between Oxybutynin ER and placebo was statistically significant. \u2020 Covariate adjusted mean with missing observations set to baseline values Figure 3: Mean Change (\u00b1SD) in Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per Week from Baseline (Study 1) * The difference between Oxybutynin ER and placebo was statistically significant.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one-fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin.",
      "Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets.

      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of the prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of the prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: o Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), o Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), o Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and o Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. \u2022 Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects.

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. Product meets USP Dissolution Test 6 structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2:Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. figure 1 figure 2"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u22655%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Drug Reactions Reported by \u2265 1% of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets-treated Adult Subjects in Five Double-blind, Controlled Clinical Trials of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets System/Organ Class Preferred Term Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 to 30 mg/day n = 774 % Oxybutynin IR IR = immediate release 5 to 20 mg/day n = 199 % Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3.0 5.5 Nervous System Disorders Headache 7.5 8.0 Somnolence 5.6 14.1 Dizziness 5.0 16.6 Dysgeusia 1.6 1.5 Eye Disorders Vision blurred 4.3 9.6 Dry eye 3.1 2.5 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Cough 1.9 3.0 Oropharyngeal pain 1.9 1.5 Dry throat 1.7 2.5 Nasal dryness 1.7 4.5 Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth 34.9 72.4 Constipation 8.7 15.1 Diarrhea 7.9 6.5 Dyspepsia 4.5 6.0 Nausea 4.5 11.6 Abdominal pain 1.6 2.0 Vomiting 1.3 1.5 Flatulence 1.2 2.5 Gastro-esophageal reflux disease 1.0 0.5 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Dry skin 1.8 2.5 Pruritus 1.3 1.5 Renal and Urinary Disorders Dysuria 1.9 2.0 Urinary hesitation 1.9 8.5 Urinary retention 1.2 3.0 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.6 3.0 Investigations Residual urine volume The bundled term residual urine volume consists of the preferred terms residual urine volume and residual urine volume increased. 2.3 3.5 The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin IR. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of 5 mg Oxybutynin Chloride.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S\u00ad oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. figure1 figure2"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of 5 mg Oxybutynin Chloride. Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ngh/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ngh/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S\u00ad oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. figure1 figure2"

      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: \u2022 Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), \u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), \u2022 Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and \u2022 Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. \u2022 Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) \u2022 Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( Error!

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) \u2022 Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician. Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk. Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Figure 1 Figure 2 Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson's disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations; QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence;General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. (8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6\u201315 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: lactose, mannitol, dextrose, tartaric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, triacetin, black iron oxide, propylene glycol, hypromellose. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call 1-855-361-3993 or visit avkare.com."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 mg/day to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride tablets (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by greater than or equal to 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by less than 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations; QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders : impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R\u00ad and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1:Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg (0.10 mg/kg to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (greater than 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. figure1 figure2"

Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. figure1 figure2"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by greater than or equal to 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and greater than or equal to 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call 1-855-664-7744.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one-fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Figure 1.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours 2,3,4 . In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2. Mean steady-state (\u00b1SD) R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following administration of total daily Oxybutynin Chloride Tablet dose of 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 mg/kg to 0.53 mg/kg) in children 5-15 years of age. \u2013 Plot represents all available data normalized to the equivalent of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg BID or TID at steady state Food Effects Data in the literature suggests that oxybutynin solution co-administered with food resulted in a slight delay in absorption and an increase in its bioavailability by 25% (n=18).1 Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by less than 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations; QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders : impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. ( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R\u00ad and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1:Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg (0.10 mg/kg to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (greater than 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 mg - 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by greater than or equal to 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and greater than or equal to 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment) Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. fig-1 fig-2"

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

Plot represents all available data normalized to the equivalent of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg BID or TID at steady state Food Effects Data in the literature suggests that oxybutynin solution co-administered with food resulted in a slight delay in absorption and an increase in its bioavailability by 25% (n=18) 1 . Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Figure 1.

Plot represents all available data normalized to the equivalent of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg BID or TID at steady state Food Effects Data in the literature suggests that oxybutynin solution co-administered with food resulted in a slight delay in absorption and an increase in its bioavailability by 25% (n=18) 1 . Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours 2,3,4 . In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7% ). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

      "8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician.Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk.Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus.8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2O to 33 cm H 2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6.8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age).8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment.8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "The continuous release of oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage. Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. A cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

    "description": [
      "Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22H 31NO 3\u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: [Chemical Structure] Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). [Figure 1] Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. [Figure 2] Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see TABLES 2 and 3, and FIGURES 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician. Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk. Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2O to 33 cm H 2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

    "overdosage": [
      "The continuous release of oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage. Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. A cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

    "description": [
      "Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22H 31NO 3\u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: [Chemical Structure] Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the following inert ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type-c, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate. Coloring agents are ferric oxide yellow (in all strengths), ferric oxide red (in 5 mg and 10 mg only) and ferric oxide black (in 15 mg only). System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system. The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach. As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine, the enteric coating dissolves and/or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and/or erosion. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP meets USP dissolution test 5."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). [Figure 1] Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. [Figure 2] Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see TABLES 2 and 3, and FIGURES 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks.

If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), Parkinson's disease (5.2), Myasthenia gravis (5.3), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

(8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: black iron oxide, cellulose acetate, colloidal silicon dioxide, dextrose, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tartaric acid, titanium dioxide, triacetin. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Dissolution Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. figure1 figure2"

      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. Product meets USP Dissolution Test 6 structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. figure 1 figure 2"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-(866)-562-4597.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), Parkinson's disease (5.2), Myasthenia gravis (5.3), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (incidence \u22655%) adverse reactions were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and dizziness. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Drug Reactions Reported by \u2265 1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated Adult Subjects in Five Double-blind, Controlled Clinical Trials of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets System/Organ Class Preferred Term Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 30 mg/day n = 774 % Oxybutynin chloride IR IR = immediate release 5 to 20 mg/day n = 199 % Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3.0 5.5 Nervous System Disorders Headache 7.5 8.0 Somnolence 5.6 14.1 Dizziness 5.0 16.6 Dysgeusia 1.6 1.5 Eye Disorders Vision blurred 4.3 9.6 Dry eye 3.1 2.5 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Cough 1.9 3.0 Oropharyngeal pain 1.9 1.5 Dry throat 1.7 2.5 Nasal dryness 1.7 4.5 Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth 34.9 72.4 Constipation 8.7 15.1 Diarrhea 7.9 6.5 Dyspepsia 4.5 6.0 Nausea 4.5 11.6 Abdominal pain 1.6 2.0 Vomiting 1.3 1.5 Flatulence 1.2 2.5 Gastro-esophageal reflux disease 1.0 0.5 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Dry skin 1.8 2.5 Pruritus 1.3 1.5 Renal and Urinary Disorders Dysuria 1.9 2.0 Urinary hesitation 1.9 8.5 Urinary retention 1.2 3.0 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.6 3.0 Investigations Residual urine volume The bundled term residual urine volume consists of the preferred terms residual urine volume and residual urine volume increased. 2.3 3.5 The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with Oxybutynin chloride IR. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

(8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: black iron oxide, cellulose acetate, colloidal silicon dioxide, dextrose, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tartaric acid, titanium dioxide, triacetin. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Dissolution Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Figure 1 Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours (n = 23) Parameters (Units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u22c5h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u22c5h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24 month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride oral solution, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%). Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 23 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride oral solution (n=12) with total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 22.5 mg (0.26 to 0.75 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2b (for oral solution). The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. image description image description"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride oral solution has been studied in 26 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 30 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride oral solution was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 113 mL to 133 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 143 mL to 165 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 63%. Urodynamic results were consistent with these clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride oral solution was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 192 mL to 294 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 46 cm H 2 O to 37 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 67% to 28%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2, 3, 4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours (n = 23) Parameters (Units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u22c5h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u22c5h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 . The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24 month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Oxybutynin chloride IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets compared to 0% with Oxybutynin chloride IR. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%). The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Eye Disorders: glaucoma; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing, hypertension; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall. Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing or crushing, or in children under the age of 6 years. ( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. A cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: black iron oxide, cellulose acetate, colloidal silicon dioxide, dextrose, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tartaric acid, titanium dioxide, triacetin. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3. image description"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0\u201348) (ng\u2219h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2219h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment). Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. image description image description"

These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on a human equivalent dose taking into account normalization of body surface area. Mutagenesis Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility was seen in rats at dosages up to 75 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) when administered for 2 weeks prior to mating in females and for 9 weeks prior to mating in males."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call Chartwell RX, LLC. at 1-845-232-1683.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors ( 5.2 ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 5.2 ), Myasthenia gravis ( 5.3 ), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy ( 5.4 ). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate release tablets (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by \u2265 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( 7 ) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( 7 )"

( 8.4 ) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of oxybutynin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynylphenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride USP is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablet, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: polyethylene oxide, hypromellose, sodium chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, ferric oxide (yellow), ferric oxide (red), ferric oxide (black), colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lactose monohydrate, triacetin, shellac, and propylene glycol. System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets USP uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug-layer side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand. This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 2: Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg (n=43) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 1.0 (0.6) 1.8 (1.0) T max (h) 12.7 (5.4) 11.8 (5.3) t 1/2 (h) 13.2 (6.2) 12.4 (6.1) AUC (0-48) (ng\u2022h/mL) 18.4 (10.3) 34.2 (16.9) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 21.3 (12.2) 39.5 (21.2) Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment) Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-Release Tablet 5 mg once daily. Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R-and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. fig-1 fig-2 Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient\u2019s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and 6 and Figures 3, 4, and 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience swelling of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, may produce clinically significant adverse reactions related to anticholinergic activity such as: Urinary retention and constipation Heat prostration due to decreased sweating. Heat prostration can occur when anticholinergic medicines are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Patients should be informed that anticholinergic medicines such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets may produce drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness or blurred vision. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets effects have been determined. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Patients should be informed that oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Patients should not chew, divide, or crush tablets. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. For more information call Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1-844-874-7464.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), Parkinson's disease (5.2), Myasthenia gravis (5.3), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

(8.4) Renal or Hepatic Impairment: There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician. Risk Summary Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk. Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6\u201315 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%. Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 60% to 28%. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6. 8.5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age). 8.6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets contains 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers. Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 \u2022HCl. Its structural formula is: Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets also contain the following inert ingredients: lactose, mannitol, dextrose, tartaric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, triacetin, black iron oxide, propylene glycol, hypromellose. Chemical Structure System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The unitary tablet core is composed of the drug and excipients (including the osmotically active components). There is a precision-laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the side of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core, causing the drug to go into suspension and the osmotic components to expand. This expansion pushes the drug out through the orifice. The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core, which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery. The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility. The function of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the osmotic gradient remains constant, drug delivery remains essentially constant. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. USP Drug Release Test 3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin. The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.

Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.

Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions. Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (C max and AUC) following administration of 5\u201320 mg of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5\u201315 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above). Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by \u2265 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and \u2265 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one-fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .

Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 . The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng\u2022h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng\u2022h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1 . Mean R-Oxybutynin Plasma Concentrations Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered Every 8 Hours for 1 Day in 23 Healthy Adult Volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin GRAPH 1 GRAPH 2"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/ day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng.h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng.h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and Rand S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days' duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin."

If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily. \u200bTable 2 Mean \u00b1 SD R- and S-Oxybutynin and R- and S-Desethyloxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters In Children Aged 5-15 Following Administration of 7.5 mg to 15 mg Total Daily Dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets (N=11) All Available Data Normalized to an Equivalent of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets 5 mg BID or TID at Steady State Figure 2.

Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (> 97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2"

A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 -3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of 5 mg Oxybutynin Chloride. Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ngh/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ngh/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S\u00ad oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving C max within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for the tablets. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R-and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of 5 mg Oxybutynin Chloride. Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ngh/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ngh/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics was also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S\u00ad oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (>97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. figure1 figure2"

      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",
      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility."

      "Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered."

      "Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24\u00ad week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects). Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void. Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination. Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving Cmax within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for both the tablet and syrup. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile R-oxybutynin. Table 1 Mean (SD) R- and S-Oxybutynin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Three Doses of Oxybutynin Chloride 5 mg Administered every 8 Hours (n=23) Parameters (units) R-Oxybutynin S-Oxybutynin C max (ng/mL) 3.6 (2.2) 7.8 (4.1) T max (h) 0.89 (0.34) 0.65 (0.32) AUC t (ng \u2022 h/mL) 22.6 (11.3) 35.0 (17.3) AUC inf (ng \u2022 h/mL) 24.3 (12.3) 37.3 (18.7) Figure 1. Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 23 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets (n=11) with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg) or oxybutynin chloride syrup (n=12) with total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 22.5 mg (0.26 to 0.75 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2a (for tablet) and Table 2b (for syrup).

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Figure1 Figure1"

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride, oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving Cmax within an hour, following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6% (range 1.6 to 10.9%) for both the tablet and syrup. Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile R-oxybutynin.

Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following three doses of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 1 day in 23 healthy adult volunteers. Oxybutynin chloride steady-state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 23 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets (n=11) with total daily dose ranging from 7.5 mg to 15 mg (0.22 to 0.53 mg/kg) or oxybutynin chloride syrup (n=12) with total daily dose ranging from 5 mg to 22.5 mg (0.26 to 0.75 mg/kg). Overall, most patients (86.9%) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg. Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2a (for tablet) and Table 2b (for syrup). The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily.

The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin. Figure1 Figure1"

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin Chloride Syrup should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets and oxybutynin chloride syrup were studied in 30 and in 26 children, respectively, in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 0 to 33 cm H 2 0, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 0) from 39% to 20%. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 30 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride syrup was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 113 mL to 133 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 143 mL to 165 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 63%. Urodynamic results were consistent with these clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride syrup was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 192 mL to 294 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 46 cm H 2 0 to 37 cm H 2 0, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 0) from 67% to 28%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours. 2, 3, 4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; rare anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment."

      "OVERDOSAGE Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Activated charcoal as well as a cathartic may be administered. Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation (e.g., restlessness, tremor, irritability, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations), flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention. Other symptoms may include hypotension or hypertension, respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma. Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34 year old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment."
