VIGOROUSLY ACCELERATES COMBUSTION. CAN CAUSE RAPID SUFFOCATION. CAN CAUSE ANESTHETIC EFFECTS. MAY CAUSE FROSTBITE. WARNING: Administration of Nitrous Oxide may be hazardous or contraindicated. For use only by or under the supervision of a licensed practitioner who is experienced in the use and administration of Nitrous Oxide and is familiar with the indications, effects, dosages, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and with the hazards, contraindications, and side effects and the precautions to be taken. WARNING: Inhalation of Nitrous Oxide without sufficient oxygen supply may be fatal or cause brain damage. Release of Nitrous Oxide will dilute the oxygen percentage in the atmosphere. Physiological responses due to Nitrous Oxide exposure and oxygen deficiency inhibit ability to safely respond when exposed to Nitrous Oxide concentration in excess of 10 percent. CAUTION: Avoid breathing gas. Store and use with adequate ventilation. Keep oil and grease away. Do not get liquid in eyes, on skin or clothing. Cylinder temperature should not exceed 125 F (52 C). Use only with equipment cleaned for Nitrous Oxide and rated for cylinder pressure. OPEN VALVE SLOWLY. USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MED-TECH\u2019S MATERIALS SAFETY DATA SHEET. FIRST AID: If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. CALL A PHYSICIAN.
