      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes \u2022 Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. \u2022 Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute),then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a ready-to-use vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Ready-to-Use Vial The Ready-to-use Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16.2 )]. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer's Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer's Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride injection in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible). Severe sinus bradycardia ( 4 ) Heart block greater than first degree ( 4 ) Sick sinus syndrome ( 4 ) Decompensated heart failure ( 4 ) Cardiogenic shock ( 4 ) Coadministration of IV cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil) in close proximity to esmolol hydrochloride injection ( 4 , 7 ) Pulmonary hypertension ( 4 ) Known hypersensitivity to esmolol ( 4 )"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal's Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal's angina because of unopposed alpha receptor-mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud's disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: \u2022 Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) o Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute o Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes o Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. o Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) o Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) o Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag \u2022 The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. \u2022 Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. \u2022 Do not add any additional medications to the bag.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [see Contraindications (4) ] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact [Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below). Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection [10 mg/mL] [250 mL] and Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection [20 mg/mL] [100 mL] may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. (2.1, 2.2) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min (2.2) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag and single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag. Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container Single-Dose Vial The Single-Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) ] . Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible). Severe sinus bradycardia (4) Heart block greater than first degree (4) Sick sinus syndrome (4) Decompensated heart failure (4) Cardiogenic shock (4) Coadministration of IV cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil) in close proximity to esmolol hydrochloride injection (4, 7) Pulmonary hypertension (4) Known hypersensitivity to esmolol (4)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4) ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signsofhypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection double strength may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. (2.1, 2.2) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min (2.2) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag and single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag. Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container Single-Dose Vial The Single-Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) ] . Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4) ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signsofhypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection double strength may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients.

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in non-compensatory sinus tachycardia. ( 1.1 ) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Non-compensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is also indicated in non-compensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intra-operative and Post-operative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the post-operative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or non-compensatory sinus tachycardia. ( 2.1 ) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute. Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes. Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. Additional loading doses may be administered. Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension. ( 2.2 ) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control). Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per minute. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Non-compensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1: Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 mcg per kg per minute to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intra-operative and Post-operative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore, two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 mcg per kg per min to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as follows: Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%). After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease. ( 5.5 ) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma. ( 5.9 ) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease. ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pre-treatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [see Contraindications (4) ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Intra-operative and Post-operative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e. surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects (see clonidine, guanfacine and moxonidine below). Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia. ( 7 ) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade. ( 7 ) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension. ( 7 ) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed. ( 7 ) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [DOUBLE STRENGTH] may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pre-treatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 100 mcg/kg/min, 200 mcg/kg/min and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for dosages from 50 mcg/kg/min to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73% to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pre-treatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 100 mcg/kg/min, 200 mcg/kg/min and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for dosages from 50 mcg/kg/min to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73% to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 mcg/kg/min to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 mg to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60% to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20% to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2)"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag and single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag. Single-Dose Vial The Single-Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)]. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4)]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15)"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. * Hypotension resolved during esmolol hydrochloride infusion in 63% of patients. In 80% of the remaining patients, hypotension resolved within 30 minutes following discontinuation of infusion. Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions (Frequency <3%) Psychiatric Disorders Confusional state and agitation (~2%) Anxiety, depression and abnormal thinking (<1%) Nervous System Disorders Headache (~ 2%) Paresthesia, syncope, speech disorder, and lightheadedness (<1%) Convulsions (<1%), with one death Vascular Disorders Peripheral ischemia (~1%) Pallor and flushing (<1%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Vomiting (~1%) Dyspepsia, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal discomfort (<1%) Renal and Urinary Disorders Urinary retention (<1%) 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders Cardiac arrest, Coronary arteriospasm Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema, Urticaria, Psoriasis Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection double strength may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol hydrochloride is: (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: Esmolol hydrochloride, USP has the molecular formula C 16 H 26 NO 4 Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. Esmolol hydrochloride, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Forms All Esmolol hydrochloride injection presentations are a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of esmolol hydrochloride. The formulation for esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride injection is described in the table below: The calculated osmolarity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection double strength is 312 mOsmol/L. The 250 mL and 100 mL bags are non-latex, non-PVC flexible containers with dual polypropylene ports. The flexible containers are manufactured from a specially designed multilayer polypropylene. Solutions in contact with the plastic container leach out certain chemical compounds from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals (2.1, 2.2) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) o Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute o Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes o Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute o Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) o Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) o Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per minute (2.2). 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1. Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore, two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag \u2022 The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. \u2022 Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. \u2022 Do not add any additional medications to the bag.

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: \u2022 Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. \u2022 Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. \u2022 IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and intravenous verapamil. \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta-blockers is possible). \u2022 Severe sinus bradycardia (4) \u2022 Heart block greater than first degree (4) \u2022 Sick sinus syndrome (4) \u2022 Decompensated heart failure (4) \u2022 Cardiogenic shock (4) \u2022 Coadministration of IV cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil) in close proximity to esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (4, 7) \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension (4) \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to esmolol (4)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [see Contraindications ( 4)] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta-blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta-blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta-blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta-blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta-blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta-blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta-blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta-blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta-blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7)]."

The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta-blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects (see clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below). Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta-blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta-blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta-blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] ."

Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd -degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [10 mg/mL] [250 mL] and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection [20 mg/mL] [100 mL] may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta-blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta-blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced effects typical of a beta-blocker; a decrease in heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta-blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4-hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta-blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies, significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg/kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg/kg/min for the next 4 minutes Titrate as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg/kg/min Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) Loading dose: 500 mcg/kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg/kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg/kg/min for gradual control (150 mcg/kg/min for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg/kg/min 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (stepwise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1. Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg/kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg/kg/min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg/kg/min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg/kg/min for 4 min 4 If necessary increase dose to 200 mcg/kg/min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg/kg/min, although doses as low as 25 mcg/kg/min have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg/kg/min provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore, two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg/kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg/kg/min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg/kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg/kg/min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia (refer to Figure 1). Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg/kg/min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg/kg/min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg/kg/min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg/kg/min has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride to alternative drugs, consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Avoid infusions into small veins or through butterfly catheters because of the risk of extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Each bag is for single patient use only and does not contain any preservatives. Once drug has been withdrawn from ready-to-use bag, the infusion of the bag contents should commence immediately and complete within 24 hours. Discard any unused. Do not remove unit from overwrap until ready to use. Do not use if overwrap has been previously opened or damaged. The overwrap is a moisture barrier. The inner bag maintains sterility of the solution. Tear overwrap at notch and remove premixed bag. Check for minute leaks by squeezing the inner bag firmly. If leaks are found, discard solution, as sterility may be impaired. Do not use unless the solution is clear (colorless to light yellow) and the seal is intact. Preparation for intravenous administration: \u2022 Use aseptic technique. \u2022 Suspend premixed bag from eyelet support. \u2022 Remove plastic protector from delivery port at bottom of bag. \u2022 Attach administration set. \u2022 Refer to complete directions accompanying set. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in an embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Esmolol Hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag \u2022 The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. \u2022 Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. \u2022 Do not add any additional medications to the bag.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce dose or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.8 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Diabetes mellitus: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.10 , 5.11 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg/kg/min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Reduction of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta-blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If the patient develops signs or symptoms of cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy. 5.4 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.5 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.6 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta-blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta-blockers. 5.7 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.8 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.9 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.10 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.11 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta-blocking therapy. 5.12 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta-blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta-blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence> 10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact WG Critical Care, LLC at 1-866-562-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine or guanfacine: Beta-blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, or guanfacine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta-blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta-blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published case reports, case series and clinical studies over decades of use with Esmolol during pregnancy are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. Esmolol use in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of the drug infusion (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproductive studies, administration of esmolol hydrochloride to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis did not demonstrate embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at doses up to approximately 1.6 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). In rabbits, intravenous administration of esmolol hydrochloride at approximately 2.7 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min) during organogenesis produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Esmolol use in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of the drug infusion. Because of hypotension to the mother, monitor the pregnant woman for decreased uterine blood flow and resulting fetal hypoxia. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, administration of esmolol during organogenesis, in the rat study did not demonstrate embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in doses up to 3,000 mcg (3 mg)/kg/min for 30 min. Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately 1.6 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). In rabbits, intravenous dosage of 2,500 mcg (2.5 mg)/kg/min during organogenesis, produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions, which is approximately 2.7 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of esmolol or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for esmolol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from esmolol hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta-blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta-blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta-blocker; a decrease in heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index that were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta-blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta-blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies, significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals (2.1, 2.2) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per minute (2.2) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia (refer to Table 1). Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a single dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Single Dose Vial The Single Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg Esmolol Hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) Diabetes mellitus: Increases the effect of hypoglycemic agents and masks hypoglycemic tachycardia (5.6) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [ see Contraindications (4) ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [ see Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering) . 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia : Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exihibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and/or hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250-300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride as follows: Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use This dosage form is prediluted to provide a ready-to-use, iso-osmotic solution of 10 mg/mL esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride recommended for esmolol hydrochloride intravenous administration. The ready-to-use vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared.When using a 10 mg/mL concentration, a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg infused over 1 minute, for a 70 kg patient is 3.5 mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) Diabetes mellitus: Increases the effect of hypoglycemic agents and masks hypoglycemic tachycardia ( 5.6 ) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering). 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] ."

The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Use of BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Injection and BREVIBLOC DOUBLE STRENGTH PREMIXED Injection may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5-50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10-20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3-6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60-70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20-50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1: Step-Wise Dosing In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia (refer to Table 1). Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride injection infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Single-Dose Vial The single-dose vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared. DOSAGE"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose-lowering). 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6- 6.1)]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5- 5.3)]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5- 5.5)]. Table 3: Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions (Frequency \u2265 3%) * Hypotension resolved during esmolol hydrochloride injection infusion in 63% of patients. In 80% of the remaining patients, hypotension resolved within 30 minutes following discontinuation of infusion.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12- 12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12- 12.3)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride injection infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol hydrochloride is: \u2022 (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: \u2022 Esmolol hydrochloride has the molecular formula C 16H 26NO 4Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. \u2022 Esmolol hydrochloride, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17.0 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Forms Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of esmolol hydrochloride. The formulation is described in the table below: Table 4: Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Formulation Q.S. = Quantity sufficient STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73% to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia: In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 mg to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60% to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20% to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: \u2022 Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes \u2022 Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. \u2022 Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1: Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250-300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard unused portion. Single-Dose Vial The single-dose vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection [see Contraindications (4) ] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5-50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10-20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia: In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3-6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60-70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20-50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short-term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride to prevent such events is not recommended."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1: Step-Wise Dosing In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). After administration of the second dose of the alternative agent, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is recommended for intravenous administration. It may be used to administer the appropriate loading dosage infusions by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING (16.2)]. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with 10 commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP DOSAGE"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g.,verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see OVERDOSAGE(1 0)]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering). 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal's Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta-blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clondidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Esmolol hydrochloride injection, for intravenous administration, is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol hydrochloride is: (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. Esmolol hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17.0 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Forms Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of esmolol hydrochloride. The formulation is described in the table below: Table 4: Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Formulation STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. BREVIBLOC injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. BREVIBLOC injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of BREVIBLOC injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia BREVIBLOC injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250-300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from BREVIBLOC Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from BREVIBLOC injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of BREVIBLOC injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the BREVIBLOC infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the BREVIBLOC infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use BREVIBLOC injection is available in a pre-mixed bag and ready-to-use vial. BREVIBLOC injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag \u2022 The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. \u2022 Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. \u2022 Do not add any additional Figure 1: Two-Port INTRAVIA Bag Figure 1: Two-Port INTRAVIA Bag Ready-to-Use Vial The Ready-to-use Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)]. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids BREVIBLOC injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. BREVIBLOC injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: \u2022 Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP \u2022 Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP DOSAGE 1 DOSAGE IMAGE"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop BREVIBLOC injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of BREVIBLOC injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving BREVIBLOC injection [see Contraindications ( 4 ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop BREVIBLOC injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like BREVIBLOC injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop BREVIBLOC injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 ]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate BREVIBLOC injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate BREVIBLOC injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering). 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of BREVIBLOC injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal's Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If BREVIBLOC injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, BREVIBLOC injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), BREVIBLOC injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of BREVIBLOC Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing BREVIBLOC injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after BREVIBLOC injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including BREVIBLOC injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with BREVIBLOC injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including BREVIBLOC injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5- 5.1)].

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of BREVIBLOC injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate BREVIBLOC injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) BREVIBLOC injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and BREVIBLOC injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect BREVIBLOC injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: BREVIBLOC injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of BREVIBLOC injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of BREVIBLOC injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use BREVIBLOC injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. BREVIBLOC injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. BREVIBLOC injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from BREVIBLOC injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BREVIBLOC injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BREVIBLOC injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because BREVIBLOC injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the BREVIBLOC infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of BREVIBLOC injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Injection and BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Double Strength Injection may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5-50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of BREVIBLOC injection resolved."

      "11 DESCRIPTION BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol hydrochloride is: \u2022 (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: Esmolol hydrochloride has the empirical formula C16H26NO4Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. \u2022 Esmolol hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17.0 for propranolol. 11.1 BREVIBLOC Injection Dosage Forms All BREVIBLOC injection presentations are clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic, iso-osmotic solutions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride. The formulations for BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Injection, BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Double Strength Injection, and BREVIBLOC Injection are described in the table below: The calculated osmolarity of BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Injection and BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Double Strength Injection is 312 mOsmol/L. The 250 mL and 100 mL bags are non-latex, non-PVC INTRAVIA bags with dual PVC ports. The INTRAVIA bags are manufactured from a specially designed multilayer plastic (PL 2408). Solutions in contact with the plastic container leach out certain chemical compounds from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action BREVIBLOC (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. BREVIBLOC injection inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of BREVIBLOC injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of BREVIBLOC injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10-20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, BREVIBLOC injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, BREVIBLOC injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, BREVIBLOC injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but BREVIBLOC injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of BREVIBLOC injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of BREVIBLOC infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of BREVIBLOC injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of BREVIBLOC injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, BREVIBLOC injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and BREVIBLOC was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of BREVIBLOC injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of BREVIBLOC injection for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of BREVIBLOC injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving BREVIBLOC injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. BREVIBLOC injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of BREVIBLOC injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of BREVIBLOC injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3-6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60-70% of the patients treated with BREVIBLOC injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of BREVIBLOC injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the BREVIBLOC injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20-50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with BREVIBLOC injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with BREVIBLOC injection. For both BREVIBLOC injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia (refer to Table 1). Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a single dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Single Dose Vial The Single Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg Esmolol Hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP DOSAGE"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4)]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering). 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Table 3 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions (Frequency \u22653%) * Hypotension resolved during esmolol hydrochloride infusion in 63% of patients. In 80% of the remaining patients, hypotension resolved within 30 minutes following discontinuation of infusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia: Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol Hydrochloride is: (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: Esmolol Hydrochloride has the molecular formula C16H26NO4Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. Esmolol Hydrochloride USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Form Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of esmolol hydrochloride.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exihibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: \u2022 Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) \u2022 Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2)"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250-300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1.Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2.After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard unused portion. Single-Dose Vial: The single-dose vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared. \u2022 Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4-minute intervals. (2.1, 2.2) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) \u2022 Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes \u2022 Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. \u2022 Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) \u2022 Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min (2.2) Image1.jpg"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection [see Contraindications (4)]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15)"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. *Hypotension resolved during esmolol hydrochloride infusion in 63% of patients. In 80% of the remaining patients, hypotension resolved within 30 minutes following discontinuation of infusion. Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions (Frequency < 3%): Psychiatric Disorders: Confusional state and agitation (~2%) Anxiety, depression and abnormal thinking (< 1%) Nervous System Disorders: Headache (~2%) Paresthesia, syncope, speech disorder, and lightheadedness (< 1%) Convulsions (< 1%), with one death Vascular Disorders: Peripheral ischemia (~1%) Pallor and flushing (< 1%) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Vomiting (~1%) Dyspepsia, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal discomfort (< 1%) Renal and Urinary Disorders: Urinary retention (< 1%) 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Cardiac arrest, Coronary arteriospasm Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, Urticaria, Psoriasis Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine- withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia: Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure: Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension: Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm: Consider intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5-50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic receptor blocker with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life is approximately 9 minutes). Esmolol hydrochloride is: \u2022 (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: \u2022 Esmolol hydrochloride has the molecular formula C 16 H 26 NO 4 Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. \u2022 Esmolol hydrochloride, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17.0 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Forms Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of esmolol hydrochloride. The formulation for esmolol hydrochloride injection is described in the table below: Image4.jpg Image5.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature.Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10-20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia: In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3-6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60-70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20-50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (1.1) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (1.2) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously (2.1, 2.2) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. (2.1, 2.2) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia (2.1) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension (2.2) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min (2.2) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag and single-dose vial. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag. Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container Single-Dose Vial The Single-Dose Vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) ] . Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container"

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible). Severe sinus bradycardia (4) Heart block greater than first degree (4) Sick sinus syndrome (4) Decompensated heart failure (4) Cardiogenic shock (4) Coadministration of IV cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil) in close proximity to esmolol hydrochloride injection (4, 7) Pulmonary hypertension (4) Known hypersensitivity to esmolol (4)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease (5.5) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor (5.6) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma (5.9) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease (5.12, 5.15) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4) ]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia (7) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade (7) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension (7) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed (7) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures . Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection and esmolol hydrochloride sodium chloride injection double strength may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: \u2022 Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes \u2022 Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute. \u2022 Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per min for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250-300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use This dosage form is prediluted to provide a ready-to-use, iso-osmotic solution of 10 mg/mL esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride recommended for esmolol hydrochloride intravenous administration. The ready-to-use vial may be used to administer a loading dosage by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared. When using a 10 mg/mL concentration, a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg infused over 1 minute, for a 70 kg patient is 3.5 mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: \u2022 Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP \u2022 Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with: \u2022 Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. \u2022 Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. \u2022 IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride injection in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection and intravenous verapamil. \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible). \u2022 Severe sinus bradycardia ( 4 ) \u2022 Heart block greater than first degree ( 4 ) \u2022 Sick sinus syndrome ( 4 ) \u2022 Decompensated heart failure ( 4 ) \u2022 Cardiogenic shock ( 4 ) \u2022 Coadministration of IV cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil) in close proximity to esmolol hydrochloride injection ( 4 , 7 ) \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension ( 4 ) \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to esmolol ( 4 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection [see Contraindications (4) ] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride injection is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol hydrochloride injection 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Injection and BREVIBLOC PREMIXED Double Strength Injection may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5-50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10-20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection for dosages from 50-300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73-88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride injection with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3-6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60-70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride injection developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20-50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride injection (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride injection. For both esmolol hydrochloride injection and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician's judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician's judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection to prevent such events is not recommended."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u22654-minute intervals ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute Additional loading doses may be administered Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per min for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per min ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1 Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary, increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as follows: Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%). After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available as a ready-to-infuse premixed solution in a single-dose flexible container bag. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Premixed Flexible Container Bag The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag. Use aseptic technique when withdrawing the bolus dose. Do not add any additional medications to the bag. Figure 1: Two-Port Flexible Container Bag Figure 1"

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Esmolol hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with: Severe sinus bradycardia: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Heart block greater than first degree: Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block may precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Sick sinus syndrome: May precipitate or worsen bradycardia resulting in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Decompensated heart failure: May worsen heart failure. Cardiogenic shock: May precipitate further cardiovascular collapse and cause cardiac arrest. IV administration of cardiodepressant calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) and esmolol hydrochloride in close proximity (i.e., while cardiac effects from the other are still present); fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride and intravenous verapamil. Pulmonary hypertension: May precipitate cardiorespiratory compromise. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to esmolol or any of the inactive ingredients of the product (cross-sensitivity between beta blockers is possible).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal's Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal's angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud's disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of esmolol hydrochloride in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where esmolol hydrochloride was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride's effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial function, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3,000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1,000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2,500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1 st -, 2 nd -, 3 rd - degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride injection have resulted from dilution errors. Use of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, 10 mg per mL and 20 mg per mL, may reduce the potential for dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of: \u2022 Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short-term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Esmolol hydrochloride is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Esmolol hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of esmolol hydrochloride to prevent such events is not recommended.",

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer intravenously ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Titrate using ventricular rate or blood pressure at \u2265 4 minute intervals ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Optional loading dose: 500 mcg per kg infused over one minute \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for the next 4 minutes \u2022 Adjust dose as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg per kg per minute \u2022 Additional loading doses may be administered \u2022 Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Loading dose: 500 mcg per kg over 1 minute for gradual control (1 mg per kg over 30 seconds for immediate control) \u2022 Then 50 mcg per kg per minute for gradual control (150 mcg per kg per minute for immediate control) adjusted to a maximum of 200 (tachycardia) or 300 (hypertension) mcg per kg per minute ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing for the Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia or Noncompensatory Sinus Tachycardia Esmolol hydrochloride is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on desired ventricular response. Table 1: Step-Wise Dosing Step Action 1 Optional loading dose (500 mcg per kg over 1 minute), then 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 2 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 100 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 3 Optional loading dose if necessary, then 150 mcg per kg per min for 4 min 4 If necessary increase dose to 200 mcg per kg per min In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart-rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours. 2.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension In this setting it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control. Immediate Control \u2022 Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per min if necessary. \u2022 Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Gradual Control \u2022 Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per min for 4 minutes. \u2022 Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as outlined for supraventricular tachycardia. Refer to Maximum Recommended Doses below. Maximum Recommended Doses \u2022 For the treatment of tachycardia, maintenance infusion dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended; dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per min provide little additional heart rate-lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. \u2022 For the treatment of hypertension, higher maintenance infusion dosages (250 to 300 mcg per kg per min) may be required. The safety of doses above 300 mcg per kg per minute has not been studied. 2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished. When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride injection as follows: 1. Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride infusion rate by one-half (50%). 2. After administration of the second dose of the alternative agent, monitor the patient\u2019s response and if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. 2.4 Directions for Use Esmolol hydrochloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Esmolol hydrochloride injection is recommended for intravenous administration. It may be used to administer the appropriate loading dosage infusions by hand-held syringe while the maintenance infusion is being prepared [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) ] . Compatibility with Commonly Used Intravenous Fluids Esmolol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with 10 commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL. Esmolol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with the following solutions and was stable for at least 24 hours at controlled room temperature or under refrigeration: \u2022 Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) in Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP \u2022 Potassium Chloride (40 mEq/liter) in Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP \u2022 Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes mellitus: Increases the effect of hypoglycemic agents and masks hypoglycemic tachycardia ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4) ] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10) ] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rate. 5.6 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia In patients with hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be masked. Concomitant use of beta blockers and antidiabetic agents can enhance the effect of antidiabetic agents (blood glucose\u2013lowering) . 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions (thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering), in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal's Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If esmolol hydrochloride is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, esmolol hydrochloride can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders (including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease), esmolol hydrochloride may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of Esmolol Hydrochloride Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing esmolol hydrochloride. Heart rate increases moderately above pre-treatment levels 30 minutes after esmolol hydrochloride discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including esmolol hydrochloride, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta-blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure (accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic). Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .",

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride\u2019s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to: \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia. \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium. \u2022 Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clondidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual. \u2022 Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests. \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride. \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. \u2022 Digitalis glycosides: Risk of bradycardia ( 7 ) \u2022 Anticholinesterases: Prolongs neuromuscular blockade ( 7 ) \u2022 Antihypertensive agents: Risk of rebound hypertension ( 7 ) \u2022 Sympathomimetic drugs: Dose adjustment needed ( 7 ) \u2022 Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effect substances: Avoid concomitant use ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to produce increased fetal resorptions with minimal maternal toxicity in rabbits when given in doses approximately 8 times the maximum human maintenance dose (300 mcg/kg/min). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenicity studies in rats at intravenous dosages of esmolol hydrochloride up to 3000 mcg/kg/min (10 times the maximum human maintenance dosage) for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while a dosage of 10,000 mcg/kg/min produced maternal toxicity and lethality. In rabbits, intravenous dosages up to 1000 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes daily produced no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, while 2500 mcg/kg/min produced minimal maternal toxicity and increased fetal resorptions. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, use of esmolol in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labor or delivery has been reported to cause fetal bradycardia, which continued after termination of drug infusion. Esmolol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from esmolol hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of esmolol hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of esmolol hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No special precautions are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment because esmolol hydrochloride is metabolized by red-blood cell esterases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for esmolol in patients with renal impairment receiving a maintenance infusion of esmolol 150 mcg/kg for 4 hours. There is no information on the tolerability of maintenance infusions of esmolol using rates in excess of 150 mcg/kg or maintained longer than 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .",

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur. 10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative. 10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved.",

Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. \u2022 Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st -, 2nd -, 3rd degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. \u2022 Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. \u2022 In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur.",
      "10.2 Treatment Recommendations Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures. Bradycardia Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Symptomatic Hypotension Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Bronchospasm Consider intravenous administration of a beta 2 stimulating agent or a theophylline derivative.",
      "10.3 Dilution Errors Massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have resulted from dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Supraventricular Tachycardia In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled comparisons of esmolol hydrochloride with placebo and propranolol, maintenance doses of 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride were found to be more effective than placebo and about as effective as propranolol, 3 to 6 mg given by bolus injections, in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, principally atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The majority of these patients developed their arrhythmias postoperatively. About 60 to 70% of the patients treated with esmolol hydrochloride developed either a 20% reduction in heart rate, a decrease in heart rate to less than 100 bpm, or, rarely, conversion to normal sinus rhythm and about 95% of these patients did so at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg/min or less. The average effective dosage of esmolol hydrochloride was approximately 100 mcg/kg/min in the two studies. Other multicenter baseline-controlled studies gave similar results. In the comparison with propranolol, about 50% of patients in both the esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol groups were on concomitant digoxin. Response rates were slightly higher with both beta blockers in the digoxin-treated patients. In all studies significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 to 50% of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mmHg. The hypotension was symptomatic (mainly hyperhidrosis or dizziness) in about 12% of patients, and therapy was discontinued in about 11% of patients, about half of whom were symptomatic. Hypotension was more common with esmolol hydrochloride (53%) than with propranolol (17%). The hypotension was rapidly reversible with decreased infusion rate or after discontinuation of therapy with esmolol hydrochloride. For both esmolol hydrochloride and propranolol, hypotension was reported less frequently in patients receiving concomitant digoxin."
