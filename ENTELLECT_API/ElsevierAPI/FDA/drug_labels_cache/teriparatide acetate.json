    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Osteosarcoma : Avoid use in patients with increased risk of osteosarcoma including patients with open epiphyses, metabolic bone diseases including Paget\u2019s disease, bone metastases or history of skeletal malignancies, prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton, and hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma. ( 5.1 ) Hypercalcemia and Cutaneous Calcification : Avoid in patients known to have an underlying hypercalcemic disorder. Discontinue in patients developing worsening of previously stable cutaneous calcification. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Urolithiasis : Consider the risk/benefit in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of risk of exacerbation ( 5.3 ) Orthostatic Hypotension : Transient orthostatic hypotension may occur with initial doses of Teriparatide Injection ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Osteosarcoma An increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) was observed in male and female rats treated with teriparatide. Osteosarcoma has been reported in patients treated with Teriparatide Injection in the post marketing setting; however, an increased risk of osteosarcoma has not been observed in observational studies in humans. There are limited data assessing the risk of osteosarcoma beyond 2 years of Teriparatide Injection use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 ), and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Avoid Teriparatide Injection use in patients with (these patients are at increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma): Open epiphyses (pediatric and young adult patients) (Teriparatide Injection is not approved in pediatric patients) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Metabolic bone diseases other than osteoporosis, including Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. Bone metastases or a history of skeletal malignancies. Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton. Hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma. 5.2 Hypercalcemia and Cutaneous Calcification Hypercalcemia Teriparatide Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia. Teriparatide Injection may cause hypercalcemia and may exacerbate hypercalcemia in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . Avoid Teriparatide Injection in patients known to have an underlying hypercalcemic disorder, such as primary hyperparathyroidism. Risk of Cutaneous Calcification Including Calciphylaxis Serious reports of calciphylaxis and worsening of previously stable cutaneous calcification have been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking Teriparatide Injection. Risk factors for development of calciphylaxis include underlying auto\u00adimmune disease, kidney failure, and concomitant warfarin or systemic corticosteroid use. Discontinue Teriparatide Injection in patients who develop calciphylaxis or worsening of previously stable cutaneous calcification. 5.3 Risk of Urolithiasis In clinical trials, the frequency of urolithiasis was similar in patients treated with Teriparatide Injection and patients treated with placebo. However, Teriparatide Injection has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. If Teriparatide Injection-treated patients have pre-existing hypercalciuria or suspected/known active urolithiasis, consider measuring urinary calcium excretion. Consider the risks and benefits of use in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this condition. 5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension Teriparatide Injection should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of Teriparatide Injection in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved (without treatment) within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment. 5.5 Risk of Digoxin Toxicity Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because Teriparatide Injection transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when Teriparatide Injection is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>10%) include: arthralgia, pain, and nausea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis and Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis The safety of Teriparatide Injection in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1382 patients (21% men, 79% women) aged 28 to 86 years (mean 67 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )] . The median durations of the trials were 11 months for men and 19 months for women, with 691 patients exposed to Teriparatide Injection and 691 patients to placebo. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 16% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 19% in the placebo group. Early discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 7% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 6% in the placebo group. Table 1 lists adverse events from these two trials that occurred in \u22652% of Teriparatide Injection-treated and more frequently than placebo-treated patients. Table 1: Percentage of Patients with Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Teriparatide Injection-Treated Patients and in More Teriparatide Injection-Treated Patients than Placebo-Treated Patients from the Two Principal Osteoporosis Trials in Women and Men Adverse Events are Shown Without Attribution of Causality Teriparatide Injection N=691 Placebo N=691 Event Classification (%) (%) Body as a Whole Pain 21.3 20.5 Headache 7.5 7.4 Asthenia 8.7 6.8 Neck pain 3.0 2.7 Cardiovascular Hypertension 7.1 6.8 Angina pectoris 2.5 1.6 Syncope 2.6 1.4 Digestive System Nausea 8.5 6.7 Constipation 5.4 4.5 Diarrhea 5.1 4.6 Dyspepsia 5.2 4.1 Vomiting 3.0 2.3 Gastrointestinal disorder 2.3 2.0 Tooth disorder 2.0 1.3 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 10.1 8.4 Leg cramps 2.6 1.3 Nervous System Dizziness 8.0 5.4 Depression 4.1 2.7 Insomnia 4.3 3.6 Vertigo 3.8 2.7 Respiratory System Rhinitis 9.6 8.8 Cough increased 6.4 5.5 Pharyngitis 5.5 4.8 Dyspnea 3.6 2.6 Pneumonia 3.9 3.3 Skin and Appendages Rash 4.9 4.5 Sweating 2.2 1.7 Laboratory Findings Serum Calcium - Teriparatide Injection transiently increased serum calcium, with the maximal effect observed at approximately 4 to 6 hours post-dose. Serum calcium measured at least 16 hours post-dose was not different from pretreatment levels. In clinical trials, the frequency of at least 1 episode of transient hypercalcemia in the 4 to 6 hours after Teriparatide Injection administration was 11% of women and 6% of men treated with Teriparatide Injection compared to 2% of women and 0% of the men treated with placebo. The percentage of patients treated with Teriparatide Injection whose transient hypercalcemia was verified on consecutive measurements was 3% of women and 1% of men. Urinary Calcium - Teriparatide Injection increased urinary calcium excretion, but the frequency of hypercalciuria in clinical trials was similar for patients treated with Teriparatide Injection and placebo [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Serum Uric Acid - Teriparatide Injection increased serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 3% of Teriparatide Injection-treated patients had serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients. However, the hyperuricemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis. Renal Function - No clinically important adverse renal effects were observed in clinical studies. Assessments included creatinine clearance; measurements of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes in serum; urine specific gravity and pH; and examination of urine sediment. Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis The safety of Teriparatide Injection in the treatment of men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with \u22655 mg per day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . The duration of the trial was 18 months with 214 patients exposed to Teriparatide Injection and 214 patients exposed to an oral daily bisphosphonate (active control). All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. There was no increase in mortality in the Teriparatide Injection group compared to the active control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 21% in Teriparatide Injection patients and 18% in active control patients, and included pneumonia (3% Teriparatide Injection, 1% active control). Early discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15% of Teriparatide Injection patients and 12% of active control patients, and included dizziness (2% Teriparatide Injection, 0% active control). Adverse events reported at a higher incidence in the Teriparatide Injection group and with at least a 2% difference in Teriparatide Injection-treated patients compared with active control-treated patients were: nausea (14%, 7%), gastritis (7%, 3%), pneumonia (6%, 3%), dyspnea (6%, 3%), insomnia (5%, 1%), anxiety (4%, 1%), and herpes zoster (3%, 1%), respectively. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other teriparatide products may be misleading. In the clinical trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , antibodies that cross reacted with teriparatide were detected in 3% of women (15/541) who received Teriparatide Injection. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and diminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions among these patients. Antibody formation did not appear to have effects on serum calcium, or on bone mineral density (BMD) response. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Teriparatide Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of bone tumor and osteosarcoma have been reported rarely in the postmarketing period [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypercalcemia greater than 13 mg/dL has been reported with Teriparatide Injection use. Adverse events reported since market introduction that were temporally related to Teriparatide Injection therapy include the following: Allergic Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, drug hypersensitivity, angioedema, urticaria Investigations: Hyperuricemia Respiratory System: Acute dyspnea, chest pain Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasms of the leg or back Other: Injection site reactions including injection site pain, swelling and bruising; oro-facial edema Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies to Assess Incidence of Osteosarcoma Two osteosarcoma surveillance safety studies (U.S. claims-based database studies) were designed to obtain data on the incidence rate of osteosarcoma among Teriparatide Injection-treated patients. In these two studies, three and zero osteosarcoma cases were identified among 379,283 and 153,316 Teriparatide Injection users, respectively. The study results suggest a similar risk for osteosarcoma between Teriparatide Injection users and their comparators. However, the interpretation of the study results calls for caution owing to the limitations of the data sources which do not allow for complete measurement and control for confounders."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Consider discontinuing when pregnancy is recognized ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness not established. Avoid use due to increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Teriparatide Injection use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Consider discontinuing Teriparatide Injection when pregnancy is recognized. In animal reproduction studies, teriparatide increased skeletal deviations and variations in mouse offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 60 times the recommended 20 mcg human daily dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m 2 ), and produced mild growth retardation and reduced motor activity in rat offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 120 times the human dose (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background risk in the US general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, pregnant mice received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses equivalent to 8 to 267 times the human dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m 2 ).

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Teriparatide Injection use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Consider discontinuing Teriparatide Injection when pregnancy is recognized. In animal reproduction studies, teriparatide increased skeletal deviations and variations in mouse offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 60 times the recommended 20 mcg human daily dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m 2 ), and produced mild growth retardation and reduced motor activity in rat offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 120 times the human dose (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background risk in the US general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, pregnant mice received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses equivalent to 8 to 267 times the human dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m 2 ).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis and Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis Effects on Mineral Metabolism - Teriparatide affects calcium and phosphorus metabolism in a pattern consistent with the known actions of endogenous PTH (e.g., increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphorus). Serum Calcium Concentrations - When teriparatide 20 mcg was administered once daily, the serum calcium concentration increased transiently, beginning approximately 2 hours after dosing and reaching a maximum concentration between 4 and 6 hours (median increase, 0.4 mg/dL). The serum calcium concentration began to decline approximately 6 hours after dosing and returned to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose. In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with Teriparatide Injection (20 mcg subcutaneous once daily) was 9.68 mg/dL at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 11 mg/dL in >99% of women at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed. In this study, 11.1% of women treated with Teriparatide Injection had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (10.6 mg/dL) compared with 1.5% of women treated with placebo. The percentage of women treated with Teriparatide Injection whose serum calcium was above the ULN on consecutive 4- to 6-hour post-dose measurements was 3% compared with 0.2% of women treated with placebo. In these women, calcium supplements and/or Teriparatide Injection doses were reduced. The timing of these dose reductions was at the discretion of the investigator. Teriparatide Injection dose adjustments were made at varying intervals after the first observation of increased serum calcium (median 21 weeks). During these intervals, there was no evidence of progressive increases in serum calcium. In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, the effects on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with Teriparatide Injection was 9.44 mg/dL at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 11 mg/dL in 98% of men at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed. In this study, 6% of men treated with Teriparatide Injection daily had at least 1 serum calcium value above the ULN (10.6 mg/dL) compared with none of the men treated with placebo. The percentage of men treated with Teriparatide Injection whose serum calcium was above the ULN on consecutive measurements was 1.3% (2 men) compared with none of the men treated with placebo. Calcium supplementation was reduced in these men [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) ] . In a clinical study of women previously treated for 18 to 39 months with raloxifene (n=26) or alendronate (n=33), mean serum calcium >12 hours after Teriparatide Injection treatment was increased by 0.36 to 0.56 mg/dL, after 1 to 6 months of Teriparatide Injection treatment compared with baseline. Of the women pretreated with raloxifene, 3 (11.5%) had a serum calcium >11 mg/dL, and of those pretreated with alendronate, 3 (9.1%) had a serum calcium >11 mg/dL. The highest serum calcium reported was 12.5 mg/dL. None of the women had symptoms of hypercalcemia. There were no placebo controls in this study. In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of Teriparatide Injection on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids. Urinary Calcium Excretion - In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily Teriparatide Injection increased urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 190 mg/day at 6 months and 170 mg/day at 12 months. These levels were 30 mg/day and 12 mg/day higher, respectively, than in women treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (>300 mg/day) was similar in the women treated with Teriparatide Injection or placebo. In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily Teriparatide Injection had inconsistent effects on urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 220 mg/day at 1 month and 210 mg/day at 6 months. These levels were 20 mg/day higher and 8 mg/day lower, respectively, than in men treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (>300 mg/day) was similar in the men treated with Teriparatide Injection or placebo. Phosphorus and Vitamin D - In single-dose studies, teriparatide produced transient phosphaturia and mild transient reductions in serum phosphorus concentration. However, hypophosphatemia (<2.4 mg/dL) was not observed in clinical trials with Teriparatide Injection. In clinical trials of daily Teriparatide Injection, the median serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was increased at 12 months by 19% in women and 14% in men, compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration decreased by 2% in women and increased by 5% in men. The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at 12 months was decreased by 19% in women and 10% in men compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration was unchanged in women and increased by 1% in men. In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of Teriparatide Injection on serum phosphorus were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids. Effects on Markers of Bone Turnover - Daily administration of Teriparatide Injection to men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in clinical studies stimulated bone formation, as shown by increases in the formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP). Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men. In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of Teriparatide Injection on serum markers of bone turnover were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Teriparatide is absorbed after subcutaneous injection; the absolute bioavailability is approximately 95% based on pooled data from 20-, 40-, and 80- mcg doses (1-, 2-, and 4- times the recommended dosage, respectively). The peptide reaches peak serum concentrations about 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection of a 20-mcg dose and declines to non-quantifiable concentrations within 3 hours. Distribution - Volume of distribution following intravenous injection is approximately 0.12 L/kg. Elimination - Systemic clearance of teriparatide (approximately 62 L/hour in women and 94 L/hour in men) exceeds the rate of normal liver plasma flow, consistent with both hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance. The half-life of teriparatide in serum was approximately 1 hour when administered by subcutaneous injection. No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide. Peripheral metabolism of PTH is believed to occur by non-specific enzymatic mechanisms in the liver followed by excretion via the kidneys. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients - No age-related differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected (range 31 to 85 years). Male and Female Patients - Although systemic exposure to teriparatide was approximately 20% to 30% lower in men than women, the recommended dosage for men and women is the same. Racial Groups - The influence of race has not been determined. Patients with Renal Impairment - No pharmacokinetic differences were identified in 11 patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30 to 72 mL/minute administered a single dose of teriparatide. In 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl<30 mL/minute), the AUC and T 1/2 of teriparatide were increased by 73% and 77%, respectively. Maximum serum concentration of teriparatide was not increased. No studies have been performed in patients undergoing dialysis for chronic renal failure. Patients with Hepatic Impairment - No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. Non-specific proteolytic enzymes in the liver (possibly Kupffer cells) cleave PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-84) into fragments that are cleared from the circulation mainly by the kidney. Drug Interaction Studies Digoxin - In a study of 15 healthy people administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single Teriparatide Injection dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin\u2019s calcium-mediated cardiac effect). Hydrochlorothiazide - In a study of 20 healthy people, the coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with 40 mcg of Teriparatide Injection (2 times the recommended dose) did not affect the serum calcium response to Teriparatide Injection. The 24-hour urine excretion of calcium was reduced by a clinically unimportant amount (15%). The effect of coadministration of a higher dose of hydrochlorothiazide with Teriparatide Injection on serum calcium levels has not been studied. Furosemide - In a study of 9 healthy people and 17 patients with CrCl 13 to 72 mL/minute, coadministration of intravenous furosemide (20 to 100 mg) with Teriparatide Injection 40 mcg (2 times the recommended dose) resulted in small increases in the serum calcium (2%) and 24-hour urine calcium (37%); however, these changes did not appear to be clinically important."

In the first study, male and female rats were given daily subcutaneous teriparatide injections of 5, 30, or 75 mcg/kg/day for 24 months from 2 months of age. These doses resulted in rat systemic exposures that were 3, 20, and 60 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans, respectively, following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Teriparatide treatment resulted in a marked dose-related increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma, a rare malignant bone tumor, in both male and female rats. Osteosarcomas were observed at all doses and the incidence reached 40% to 50% in the high-dose groups. Teriparatide also caused a dose-related increase in osteoblastoma and osteoma in both sexes. No osteosarcomas, osteoblastomas or osteomas were observed in untreated control rats. The bone tumors in rats occurred in association with a large increase in bone mass and focal osteoblast hyperplasia. The second 2-year study was carried out in order to determine the effect of treatment duration and animal age on the development of bone tumors. Female rats were treated for different periods between 2 and 26 months of age with subcutaneous teriparatide doses of 5 and 30 mcg/kg (equivalent to 3 and 20 times the human exposure at the 20-mcg dose, respectively, based on AUC comparison). The study showed that the occurrence of osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma and osteoma was dependent upon dose and duration of teriparatide exposure. Bone tumors were observed when immature 2-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 24 months or with 5 or 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 months. Bone tumors were also observed when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 or 20 months. Tumors were not detected when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 5 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 or 20 months. The results did not demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to bone tumor formation, associated with teriparatide treatment, between mature and immature rats. No bone tumors were detected in a long-term monkey study [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Mutagenesis Teriparatide was not genotoxic in any of the following test systems: the Ames test for bacterial mutagenesis; the mouse lymphoma assay for mammalian cell mutation; the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without metabolic activation; and the in vivo micronucleus test in mice. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous teriparatide doses of 30, 100, or 300 mcg/kg/day prior to mating and in females continuing through gestation Day 6 (16 to 160 times the human dose of 20 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 ). 13.2 Animal Toxicology In single-dose rodent studies using subcutaneous injection of teriparatide, no mortality was seen in rats given doses of 1000 mcg/kg (540 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m 2 ) or in mice given 10,000 mcg/kg (2700 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m 2 ). In a long-term study, skeletally mature ovariectomized female monkeys (N=30 per treatment group) were given either daily subcutaneous teriparatide injections of 5 mcg/kg or vehicle. Following the 18-month treatment period, the monkeys were removed from teriparatide treatment and were observed for an additional 3 years. The 5 mcg/kg dose resulted in systemic exposures that were approximately 6 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Bone tumors were not detected by radiographic or histologic evaluation in any monkey in the study."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women The safety and efficacy of once-daily Teriparatide Injection, median exposure of 19 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 1637 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In this study 541 postmenopausal women were treated with 20 mcg Teriparatide Injection subcutaneously once daily. All women received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. Baseline and endpoint spinal radiographs were evaluated using the semiquantitative scoring. Ninety percent of the women in the study had 1 or more radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures defined as changes in the height of previously undeformed vertebrae. Such fractures are not necessarily symptomatic. Effect on Fracture Incidence New Vertebral Fractures - Teriparatide Injection, when taken with calcium and vitamin D and compared with calcium and vitamin D alone, reduced the risk of 1 or more new vertebral fractures from 14.3% of women in the placebo group to 5.0% in the Teriparatide Injection group (444 of the 541 patients treated with 20 mcg once daily of Teriparatide Injection were included in this analysis). This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001); the absolute reduction in risk was 9.3% and the relative reduction was 65%. Teriparatide Injection was effective in reducing the risk for vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, or baseline BMD ( see Table 2). Table 2: Effect of Teriparatide Injection on Risk of Vertebral Fractures in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis Percent of Women With Fracture Teriparatide Injection (N=444) Placebo (N=448) Absolute Risk Reduction (%, 95% CI) Relative Risk Reduction (%, 95% CI) New fracture (\u22651) 5.0 a 14.3 9.3 (5.5-13.1) 65 (45-78) 1 fracture 3.8 9.4 2 fractures 0.9 2.9 \u22653 fractures 0.2 2.0 a p\u22640.001 compared with placebo. New Nonvertebral Osteoporotic Fractures - Teriparatide Injection significantly reduced the risk of any nonvertebral fracture from 5.5% in the placebo group to 2.6% in the Teriparatide Injection group (p<0.05). The absolute reduction in risk was 2.9% and the relative reduction was 53%. The incidence of new nonvertebral fractures in the Teriparatide Injection group compared with the placebo group was ankle/foot (0.2%, 0.7%), hip (0.2%, 0.7%), humerus (0.4%, 0.4%), pelvis (0%, 0.6%), ribs (0.6%, 0.9%), wrist (0.4%, 1.3%), and other sites (1.1%, 1.5%), respectively. The cumulative percentage of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who sustained new nonvertebral fractures was lower in women treated with Teriparatide Injection than in women treated with placebo ( see Figure 1). Figure 1: Cumulative Percentage of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis Sustaining New Nonvertebral Osteoporotic Fractures Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Teriparatide Injection increased lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Statistically significant increases were seen at 3 months and continued throughout the treatment period. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were treated with Teriparatide Injection had statistically significant increases in BMD from baseline to endpoint at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body ( see Table 3). Table 3: Mean Percent Change in BMD from Baseline to Endpoint a in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis, Treated with Teriparatide Injection or Placebo for a Median of 19 Months Teriparatide Injection N=541 Placebo N=544 Lumbar spine BMD 9.7 b 1.1 Femoral neck BMD 2.8 c -0.7 Total hip BMD 2.6 c -1.0 Trochanter BMD 3.5 c -0.2 Intertrochanter BMD 2.6 c -1.3 Ward\u2019s triangle BMD 4.2 c -0.8 Total body BMD 0.6 c -0.5 Distal 1/3 radius BMD -2.1 -1.3 Ultradistal radius BMD -0.1 -1.6 a Intent-to-treat analysis, last observation carried forward. b p<0.001 compared with placebo. c p<0.05 compared with placebo. Teriparatide Injection treatment increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 96% of postmenopausal women treated. Seventy-two percent of patients treated with Teriparatide Injection achieved at least a 5% increase in spine BMD, and 44% gained 10% or more. Both treatment groups lost height during the trial. The mean decreases were 3.61 and 2.81 mm in the placebo and Teriparatide Injection groups, respectively. Bone Histology The effects of Teriparatide Injection on bone histology were evaluated in iliac crest biopsies of 35 postmenopausal women treated for 12 to 24 months with calcium and vitamin D and Teriparatide Injection. Normal mineralization was observed with no evidence of cellular toxicity. The new bone formed with Teriparatide Injection was of normal quality (as evidenced by the absence of woven bone and marrow fibrosis). 1 14.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis The safety and efficacy of once-daily Teriparatide Injection, median exposure of 10 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 437 men with either primary (idiopathic) or hypogonadal osteoporosis. In this study, 151 men received 20 mcg of Teriparatide Injection given subcutaneously once daily. All men received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD. Teriparatide Injection increased lumbar spine BMD in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis. Statistically significant increases were seen at 3 months and continued throughout the treatment period. Teriparatide Injection was effective in increasing lumbar spine BMD regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD. The effects of Teriparatide Injection at additional skeletal sites are shown in Table 4. Teriparatide Injection treatment for a median of 10 months increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 94% of men treated. Fifty-three percent of patients treated with Teriparatide Injection achieved at least a 5% increase in spine BMD, and 14% gained 10% or more.

The duration of the trial was 18 months. In the trial 214 patients were treated with Teriparatide Injection 20 mcg given subcutaneously once daily. In the Teriparatide Injection group, the baseline median glucocorticoid dose was 7.5 mg/day and the baseline median duration of glucocorticoid use was 1.5 years. The mean (SD) baseline lumbar spine BMD was 0.85 \u00b1 0.13 g/cm 2 and lumbar spine BMD T-score was \u20132.5 \u00b1 1 (number of standard deviations below the mean BMD value for healthy adults). A total of 30% of patients had prevalent vertebral fracture(s) and 43% had prior non-vertebral fracture(s). The patients had chronic rheumatologic, respiratory or other diseases that required sustained glucocorticoid therapy. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. Because of differences in mechanism of action (anabolic vs. anti-resorptive) and lack of clarity regarding differences in BMD as an adequate predictor of fracture efficacy, data on the active comparator are not presented. Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) In patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, Teriparatide Injection increased lumbar spine BMD compared with baseline at 3 months through 18 months of treatment. In patients treated with Teriparatide Injection, the mean percent change in BMD from baseline to endpoint was 7.2% at the lumbar spine, 3.6% at the total hip, and 3.7% at the femoral neck (p <0.001 all sites). The relative treatment effects of Teriparatide Injection were consistent in subgroups defined by gender, age, geographic region, body mass index, underlying disease, prevalent vertebral fracture, baseline glucocorticoid dose, prior bisphosphonate use, and glucocorticoid discontinuation during trial."
