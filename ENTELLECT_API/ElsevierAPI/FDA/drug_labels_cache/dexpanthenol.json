    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Aluminum Toxicity: For at risk patients (renal failure or those with prolonged therapy), consider periodic monitoring of aluminum levels ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions: To thiamine may occur ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypervitaminosis A : Patients with renal failure or liver disease may be at higher risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin: Monitor INR ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interferes with Megaloblastic Anemia Diagnosis: Avoid during testing for this disorder ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses: Monitor blood vitamin concentrations ( 5.6 ) \u2022 False Negative Urine Glucose Tests: Due to vitamin C ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin E Toxicity: Additional oral and parenteral vitamin E may result in elevated vitamin E blood concentrations in infants ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Low Vitamin A Levels: Monitor vitamin A levels ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome: Due to polysorbates ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Aluminum Toxicity INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solution, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. To prevent aluminum toxicity periodically monitor aluminum levels with prolonged parenteral administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. 5.2 Allergic Reactions to Thiamine Allergic reactions such as urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing and angioedema have been reported following intravenous administration of thiamine, which is found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. There have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following intravenous doses of thiamine. No fatal anaphylaxis associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported. 5.3. Hypervitaminosis A Hypervitaminosis A, manifested by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision has been reported in patients with renal failure receiving 1.5 mg/day retinol and in patients with liver disease. Therefore, supplementation of renal failure patients and patients with liver disease with vitamin A, an ingredient found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, should be undertaken with caution [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) ]. Blood levels of Vitamin A should be monitored periodically. 5.4 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains Vitamin K which may decrease the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are on warfarin anticoagulant therapy receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC monitor blood levels of prothrombin/INR to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted. 5.5 Interference with Diagnosis of Megaloblastic Anemia INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains folic acid and cyanocobalamin which can mask serum deficiencies of folic acid and cyanocobalamin in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Avoid the use of INFUVITE PEDIATRICS in patients with suspected or diagnosed megaloblastic anemia prior to blood sampling for the detection of the folic acid and cyanocobalamin deficiencies. 5.6 Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins such as with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 5.7 Interference with Urine Glucose Testing INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose results. 5.8 Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E Additional vitamin E supplementations of patients receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parental doses of vitamin E in infants. Daily dose of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E. 5.9 Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels Lower vitamin A concentrations may occur after administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC due to the adherence of Vitamin A to plastic. Monitor blood vitamin A concentrations periodically. Additional administration of therapeutic doses of vitamin A may be required, especially in low-birth weight infants. 5.10 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome in Low-Birth Weight Infants E-Ferol syndrome manifested by thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, ascites, hypotension and metabolic acidosis has been reported in low-birth weight infants following administration of polysorbates which are found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. No E-Ferol syndrome associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of interactions between vitamins and drugs have been reported. The following are examples of these types of interactions. Effect of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC on other drugs : \u2022 Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin may reduce the activity of bleomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease blood levels of levodopa and levodopa efficacy may decrease ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Phenytoin: Folic acid may decrease phenytoin blood levels and increase risk of seizure activity ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease response to methotrexate ( 7.1 ) Effects of other drugs on INFUVITE PEDIATRIC: \u2022 Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements ( 7.2 ). \u2022 Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions Affecting Co-administered Drugs Warfarin : Vitamin K, a component of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood levels of prothrombin/INR should be monitored to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Antibiotics : Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. Bleomycin : Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro , thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced. Levodopa : Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood levels of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy. Phenytoin : Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity. Methotrexate : Folic acid may decrease a patient\u2019s response to methotrexate therapy. 7.2 Drug Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels Hydralazine, Isoniazid : Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements. Phenytoin : Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations."
