    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate . Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma ( 5.5 ). \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 to 4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. The dosage of solifenacin succinate greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with solifenacin succinate can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years) [8.5]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [8.6]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [8.7]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22653 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy ( 5.1 ). Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction ( 5.2 ). Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility ( 5.3 ). Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them ( 5.4 ). Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma ( 5.5 ). QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4)] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 to 4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

( 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (1 2.3 )] . The dosage of solifenacin succinate greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u226565 years and 189 patients \u226575 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients <65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t1/2) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22653 months duration. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1,811 on solifenacin succinate and 1,216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u25cf Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u25cf Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) \u25cf Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) \u25cf Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) \u25cf Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) \u25cf QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., at 1-866-562-4616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo- controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [ see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with solifenacin succinate can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Solifenacin succinate is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, solifenacin succinate is butanedioic acid, compounded with (1 S )-(3 R )-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1 H ) iso-quinoline carboxylate (1:1) having an empirical formula of C 23 H 26 N 2 O 2 \u2022C 4 H 6 O 4 , and a molecular weight of 480.55. The structural formula of solifenacin succinate is: Solifenacin succinate is a white to pale yellowish white powder. It is soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, water and insoluble in n-hexane. Each solifenacin succinate tablet contains 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin succinate and is formulated for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient solifenacin succinate, each solifenacin succinate tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, hypromellose 2910, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 8000, pregelatinized starch, talc, and titanium dioxide with yellow ferric oxide (5 mg solifenacin succinate tablet) or red ferric oxide (10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive- controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1 Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased Cmax and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean Cmax and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S - warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.3 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in Solifenacin Succinate Tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Solifenacin Succinate Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use .In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin Succinate Tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy. (5.1) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. (5.2) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. (5.3) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. (5.4) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.5) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patient with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medication known to prolong the QT interval. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reaction may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4)] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate tabletsare not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and >placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 to 4) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical studies (14)]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Do not exceed the 5 mg dose of solifenacin succinate tablets with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. (7.1) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The dosage of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u226565 years and 189 patients \u226575 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients <65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] and solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3, 6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4, 13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t1/2) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Solifenacin succinate tablet has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22653 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate tablets are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., at 1-866-562-4616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo- controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [ see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with solifenacin succinate can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Solifenacin succinate is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, solifenacin succinate is butanedioic acid, compounded with (1 S )-(3 R )-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1 H ) iso-quinoline carboxylate (1:1) having an empirical formula of C 23 H 26 N 2 O 2 \u2022C 4 H 6 O 4 , and a molecular weight of 480.55. The structural formula of solifenacin succinate is: Solifenacin succinate is a white to pale yellowish white powder. It is soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, water and insoluble in n-hexane. Each solifenacin succinate tablet contains 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin succinate and is formulated for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient solifenacin succinate, each solifenacin succinate tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, hypromellose 2910, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 8000, pregelatinized starch, talc, and titanium dioxide with yellow ferric oxide (5 mg solifenacin succinate tablet) or red ferric oxide (10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive- controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1 Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased Cmax and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. D rug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean Cmax and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S - warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. O r al Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC decreased by 1%. D i g oxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the i n vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the i n vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.3 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue Solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. (5.1) \u2022 Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. (5.2) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. (5.3) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affects them. (5.4) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.5) \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4 )]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4 )]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4 )]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

(7.1) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The dosage of solifenacin succinate greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% (in vivo) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy\u00acN-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that Cmax, AUC and t1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

( 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with solifenacin succinate can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1).

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in Solifenacin Succinate Tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Solifenacin Succinate Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively.

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin Succinate Tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., at 1-866-562-4616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo- controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [ see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with solifenacin succinate can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Solifenacin succinate is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, solifenacin succinate is butanedioic acid, compounded with (1 S )-(3 R )-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1 H ) iso-quinoline carboxylate (1:1) having an empirical formula of C 23 H 26 N 2 O 2 \u2022C 4 H 6 O 4 , and a molecular weight of 480.55. The structural formula of solifenacin succinate is: Solifenacin succinate is a white to pale yellowish white powder. It is soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, water and insoluble in n-hexane. Each solifenacin succinate tablet contains 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin succinate and is formulated for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient solifenacin succinate, each solifenacin succinate tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, hypromellose 2910, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 8000, pregelatinized starch, talc, and titanium dioxide with yellow ferric oxide (5 mg solifenacin succinate tablet) or red ferric oxide (10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive- controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1 Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased Cmax and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean Cmax and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S - warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.3 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

( 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 to 4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinic al Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection, and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1,811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1,188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 years to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 mg and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 beats/minute and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo) 1 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect the effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 hours to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 hours to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 years to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 years to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin . Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 hours to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 hours to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 years to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 years to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin . Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1,811 on solifenacin succinate tablets and 1,216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate tablets are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [ see Contraindications (4) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using meandifference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S - warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S - warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively."

The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate are reported in Tables 3 through 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions: Reports of angioedema of the face, lips and/or larynx, in some cases occurring after the first dose, have been described. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely (5.1). Urinary Retention: Administer with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction (5.2). Gastrointestinal Disorders: Use with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility (5.3). Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affects them (5.4). Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma (5.5). QT Prolongation: Use with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval (5.8). 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, solifenacin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin succinate should not be used in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate. In patients who develop anaphylactic reactions, solifenacin succinate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken. 5.2 Urinary Retention Solifenacin succinate tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Solifenacin succinate tablets, like other anticholinergics, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] the QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of solifenacin 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. This observation should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe solifenacin succinate tablets for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection, and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 patients in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets was higher in the 10 mg compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema has been reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, derived from all reported adverse events, in randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the concentration of solifenacin succinate tablets (7.1). Inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin succinate tablets (7.2). 7.1 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following the administration of 10 mg of solifenacin succinate tablets in the presence of 400 mg of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended not to exceed a 5 mg daily dose of solifenacin succinate tablets when administered with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors were not examined. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inducers There were no in vivo studies conducted to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on solifenacin succinate tablets. In vitro drug metabolism studies have shown that solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Therefore, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. 7.3 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes. 7.4 Warfarin Solifenacin has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of R -warfarin or S -warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of solifenacin there are no significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin Solifenacin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.125 mg/day) in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers : Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Solifenacin succinate tablets should not be administered during nursing (8.1, 8.3). Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets in pediatric patients have not been established (8.4). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats and rabbits. After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice, drug-related material was shown to cross the placental barrier. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice at 3.6 times and greater (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the exposure at the MRHD, during the major period of organ development resulted in reduced fetal body weights. Administration of 7.9 times (250 mg/kg/day) the MRHD to pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate. In utero and lactational exposures to maternal doses of solifenacin succinate of 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the MRHD resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reductions in body weight gain, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. No embryotoxic effects were observed in rats at up to 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) or in rabbits at up to 1.8 times (50 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, solifenacin succinate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of solifenacin succinate tablets on labor and delivery in humans has not been studied. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate at 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater increased peripartum pup mortality. 8.3 Nursing Mothers After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice, radioactivity was detected in maternal milk. There were no adverse observations in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]. Pups of female mice treated with 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater revealed reduced body weights, postpartum pup mortality or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development during the lactation period. It is not known whether solifenacin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, solifenacin succinate tablets should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets in nursing mothers. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between older (623 patients \u226565 years and 189 patients \u226575 years) and younger patients (1188 patients <65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate tablets. Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablets in elderly volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values were 20 to 25% higher as compared to the younger volunteers (18 to 55 years). 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. There is a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with reduced hepatic function. There is a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially. One group (n=51) went on to complete 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon co-administration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline EKG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) * Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3, 6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4, 13) *Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect appeared greater for the 30 mg compared to the 10 mg dose of solifenacin. Although the effect of the highest solifenacin dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose, the confidence intervals overlapped. This study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablets to healthy volunteers, peak plasma levels (C max ) of solifenacin are reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration, and at steady state ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, and plasma concentrations of solifenacin are proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u00b5 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 22.5% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. The elimination half-life of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Drug Interactions Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1% [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially. One group (n=51) went on to complete 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon co-administration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline EKG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) * Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3, 6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4, 13) *Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect appeared greater for the 30 mg compared to the 10 mg dose of solifenacin. Although the effect of the highest solifenacin dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose, the confidence intervals overlapped. This study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablets to healthy volunteers, peak plasma levels (C max ) of solifenacin are reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration, and at steady state ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, and plasma concentrations of solifenacin are proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u00b5 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 22.5% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. The elimination half-life of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Drug Interactions Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1% [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22653 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets doses and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose. All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate tablets was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to placebo (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions: Reports of angioedema of the face, lips and/or larynx, in some cases occurring after the first dose, have been described. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Administer with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Use with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin affects them ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation: Use with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, solifenacin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin succinate should not be used in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate. In patients who develop anaphylactic reactions, solifenacin succinate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken. 5.2 Urinary Retention Solifenacin, like other anticholinergic drugs, should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Solifenacin, like other anticholinergics, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Doses of Solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Doses of Solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. 5.8 Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] the QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of solifenacin 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. This observation should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe Solifenacin for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% and > placebo) were dry mouth, and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection, and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 patients in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin was higher in the 10 mg compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema has been reported in one patient taking Solifenacin 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, derived from all reported adverse events, in randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the concentration of Solifenacin ( 7.1 ). Inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of Solifenacin ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following the administration of 10 mg of Solifenacin in presence of 400 mg of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended not to exceed a 5 mg daily dose of Solifenacin when administered with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. The effects of weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors were not examined. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inducers There were no in vivo studies conducted to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on Solifenacin. In vitro drug metabolism studies have shown that solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Therefore, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. 7.3 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes. 7.4 Warfarin Solifenacin has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin or S-warfarin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.5 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of solifenacin there are no significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.6 Digoxin Solifenacin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.125 mg/day) in healthy subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers: Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should not be administered during nursing ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats and rabbits. After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice, drug-related material was shown to cross the placental barrier. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice at 3.6 times and greater (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the exposure at the MRHD, during the major period of organ development resulted in reduced fetal body weights. Administration of 7.9 times (250 mg/kg/day) the MRHD to pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate. In utero and lactational exposures to maternal doses of solifenacin succinate of 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the MRHD resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reductions in body weight gain, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. No embryotoxic effects were observed in rats at up to 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) or in rabbits at up to 1.8 times (50 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Solifenacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of Solifenacin on labor and delivery in humans has not been studied. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate at 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater increased peripartum pup mortality. 8.3 Nursing Mothers After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice, radioactivity was detected in maternal milk. There were no adverse observations in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]. Pups of female mice treated with 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater revealed reduced body weights, postpartum pup mortality or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development during the lactation period. It is not known whether solifenacin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Solifenacin should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Solifenacin in nursing mothers. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between older (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with Solifenacin. Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin in elderly volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values were 20-25% higher as compared to the younger volunteers (18 to 55 years). 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. There is a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment. Doses of Solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ); Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with reduced hepatic function. There is a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Doses of Solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ); Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets can potentially result in severe anticholinergic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable anticholinergic side effects (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially. One group (n=51) went on to complete 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon co-administration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline EKG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2. QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo)* Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin 30 mg (4,13) *Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect appeared greater for the 30 mg compared to the 10 mg dose of solifenacin. Although the effect of the highest solifenacin dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose, the confidence intervals overlapped. This study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin to healthy volunteers, peak plasma levels (C max ) of solifenacin are reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration, and at steady state ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, and plasma concentrations of solifenacin are proportional to the dose administered. Effect of food Solifenacin may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin with food increased C max and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d1-acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 22.5% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. The elimination half-life of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Drug Interactions Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 ) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin doses and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose. All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of Solifenacin was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and Solifenacin 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and Solifenacin 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to placebo (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with Solifenacin 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and Solifenacin 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma ( 5.5 ). \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4)] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 to 4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u226565 years and 189 patients \u226575 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients <65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics C ardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1 Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t1/2) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors I n a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics C ardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22653 months duration. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1,811 on solifenacin succinate and 1,216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions: Reports of angioedema of the face, lips and/or larynx, in some cases occurring after the first dose, have been described. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely ( 5.1 ). \u00b7 Urinary Retention: Administer with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction ( 5.2 ). \u00b7 Gastrointestinal Disorders: Use with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility ( 5.3 ). \u00b7 Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them ( 5.4 ). \u00b7 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma ( 5.5 ) . \u00b7 QT Prolongation: Use with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, solifenacin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin succinate should not be used in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate. In patients who develop anaphylactic reactions, solifenacin succinate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken. 5.2 Urinary Retention Solifenacin succinate, like other anticholinergic drugs, should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Solifenacin succinate, like other anticholinergics, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Doses of solifenacin succinate greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin on the QT interval in 76 healthy women [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] the QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of solifenacin 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. This observation should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe solifenacin succinate for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin was higher in the 10 mg compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema has been reported in one patient taking solifenacin 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, derived from all reported adverse events, in randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Table 1: Percentages of Patients with Identified Adverse Reactions, Derived from All Adverse Events Exceeding Placebo Rate and Reported by 1% or More Patients for Combined Pivotal Studies Placebo (%) Solifenacin 5 mg (%) Solifenacin 10 mg (%) Number of Patients 1216 578 1233 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Dry Mouth 4.2 10.9 27.6 Constipation 2.9 5.4 13.4 Nausea 2.0 1.7 3.3 Dyspepsia 1.0 1.4 3.9 Abdominal Pain Upper 1.0 1.9 1.2 Vomiting NOS 0.9 0.2 1.1 INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS Urinary Tract Infection NOS 2.8 2.8 4.8 Influenza 1.3 2.2 0.9 Pharyngitis NOS 1.0 0.3 1.1 NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Dizziness 1.8 1.9 1.8 EYE DISORDERS Vision Blurred 1.8 3.8 4.8 Dry Eyes NOS 0.6 0.3 1.6 RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS Urinary Retention 0.6 0 1.4 GENERAL DISORDERS ANDADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Edema Lower Limb 0.7 0.3 1.1 Fatigue 1.1 1.0 2.1 PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Depression NOS 0.8 1.2 0.8 RESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS Cough 0.2 0.2 1.1 VASCULAR DISORDERS Hypertension NOS 0.6 1.4 0.5 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide postmarketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of solifenacin in their causation cannot be reliably determined. The following events have been reported in association with solifenacin use in worldwide postmarketing experience: General : peripheral edema, hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and anaphylactic reaction; Central Nervous : headache, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and somnolence; Cardiovascular : QT prolongation,Torsade de Pointes, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and palpitations; Hepatic : liver disorders mostly characterized by abnormal liver function tests, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase); Renal : renal impairment; Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite and hyperkalemia; Dermatologic : exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and dry skin; Eye disorders : glaucoma; Gastrointestinal disorders : gastroesophageal reflux disease, ileus, abdominal pain, and dysgeusia; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : dysphonia and nasal dryness; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : muscular weakness."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u00b7 Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the concentration of solifenacin succinate ( 7.1 ). \u00b7 Inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin succinate ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following the administration of 10 mg of solifenacin in the presence of 400 mg of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean Cmax and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended not to exceed a 5 mg daily dose of solifenacin when administered with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors were not examined. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inducers There were no in vivo studies conducted to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on solifenacin. In vitro drug metabolism studies have shown that solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Therefore, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. 7.3 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes. 7.4 Warfarin Solifenacin has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of R -warfarin or S -warfarin [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of solifenacin there are no significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin Solifenacin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.125 mg/day) in healthy subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers : Solifenacin succinate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Solifenacin succinate should not be administered during nursing ( 8.1 , 8.3 ). Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin succinate in pediatric patients have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats and rabbits. After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice, drug-related material was shown to cross the placental barrier. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice at 3.6 times and greater (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the exposure at the MRHD, during the major period of organ development resulted in reduced fetal body weights. Administration of 7.9 times (250 mg/kg/day) the MRHD to pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate. In utero and lactational exposures to maternal doses of solifenacin succinate of 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the MRHD resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reductions in body weight gain, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. No embryotoxic effects were observed in rats at up to 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) or in rabbits at up to 1.8 times (50 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, solifenacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor & Delivery The effect of solifenacin on labor and delivery in humans has not been studied. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg. Administration of solifenacin succinate at 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater increased peripartum pup mortality. 8.3 Nursing Mothers After oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice, radioactivity was detected in maternal milk. There were no adverse observations in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]. Pups of female mice treated with 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day) the exposure at the MRHD or greater revealed reduced body weights, postpartum pup mortality or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development during the lactation period. It is not known whether solifenacin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, solifenacin should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue solifenacin in nursing mothers. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between older (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin. Multiple dose studies of solifenacin in elderly volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that Cmax, AUC and t1/2 values were 20-25% higher as compared to the younger volunteers (18 to 55 years). 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. There is a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment. Doses of solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with reduced hepatic function. There is a 2-fold increase in the t1/2 and 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Doses of solifenacin greater than 5 mg are not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Solifenacin is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable anticholinergic side effects (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially. One group (n=51) went on to complete 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon co-administration of 10 mg solifenacin with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline EKG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo)* Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin 30 mg 8 (4,13) *Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect appeared greater for the 30 mg compared to the 10 mg dose of solifenacin. Although the effect of the highest solifenacin dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose, the confidence intervals overlapped. This study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin to healthy volunteers, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of solifenacin are reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration, and at steady state ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, and plasma concentrations of solifenacin are proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacif may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin with food increased Cmax and AUC by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1-acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 22.5% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and in feces 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. The elimination half-life of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Drug Interactions Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg, once daily for 21 days, the mean Cmax and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean Cmax increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin when it was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel when it was administered with solifenacin, the mean Cmax and AUC decreased by 1% [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin, the mean Cmax and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially. One group (n=51) went on to complete 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon co-administration of 10 mg solifenacin with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline EKG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin doses and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose. All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label, long term extension study and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin was similar across patient age and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin 5 mg (2.3; p<0.001) and solifenacin 10 mg (2.7; p<0.001) compared to placebo, (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin 5 mg (1.5; p<0.001) and solifenacin 10 mg (1.8; p<0.001) treatment groups compared to placebo (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin 5 mg (32.3 mL; p<0.001) and solifenacin 10 mg (42.5 mL; p<0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with solifenacin succinate, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90%CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 ng/mL to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45 to 68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20 to 25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications (4) ] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets andprovide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adultpatients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QTprolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect ofsolifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AustarPharma LLC at 1-844-375-5410 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at Tmax (relative to placebo)* Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) *Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations levels (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations levels (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (<1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin Succinate Tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4).The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in Solifenacin Succinate Tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data ] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Solifenacin Succinate Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness. Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug. In the event of overdose with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin Succinate Tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are reported in Tables 3 through 6 .

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASCRX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions: Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use solifenacin succinate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation: Solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin succinate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate is associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate affects them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin has been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data] . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1. Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2. Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( in vivo ) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy- N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that C max , AUC and t 1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t 1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t 1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ] . Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10 th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S -warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12 th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : solifenacin succinate tablets is not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with solifenacin succinate tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use solifenacin succinate tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : solifenacin succinate tablets is not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue solifenacin succinate tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of solifenacin succinate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. solifenacin succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets are not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin succinate tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how solifenacin succinate tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )], solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adult patients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect of solifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. The use of solifenacin succinate tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate tablets -treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin succinate tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The dosage of solifenacin succinate tablets greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring [ see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk [see Data]. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for solifenacin succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Oral administration of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of solifenacin succinate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients \u2265 65 years and 189 patients \u2265 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients < 65 years) treated with solifenacin succinate tablets. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of solifenacin succinate tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and solifenacin succinate tablets is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Solifenacin succinate tablets (solifenacin succinate) are a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, solifenacin succinate is a butanedioic acid compound with (1S)-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)-iso-quinolinecarboxylate (1:1) having an empirical formula of C 23 H 26 N 2 O 2 \u2022C 4 H 6 O 4 , and a molecular weight of 480.55. The structural formula of solifenacin succinate is: Solifenacin succinate is a white to pale-yellowish-white crystal or crystalline powder. It is freely soluble at room temperature in water, glacial acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol. Each solifenacin succinate tablet contains 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin succinate and is formulated for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient solifenacin succinate, each solifenacin succinate tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, corn starch, hypromellose 2910, magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol 8000 and titanium dioxide with yellow ferric oxide (5 mg solifenacin succinate tablet) or red ferric oxide (10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet). 31"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole., 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days. The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: QTc changes in msec (90% CI) from baseline at T max (relative to placebo) 1 Drug/Dose Fridericia method (using mean difference) Solifenacin succinate 10 mg 2 (-3,6) Solifenacin succinate 30 mg 8 (4,13) 1 Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2 2 Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively. The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of solifenacin succinate tablet in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablet tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered. Effect of Food Solifenacin succinate tablet may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of solifenacin succinate tablets with food increased C max and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively. Distribution Solifenacin is approximately 98% (in vivo) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to \u221d1-acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600L. Elimination The elimination half-life (t1/2) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours. Metabolism Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing. Excretion Following the administration of 10 mg of 14 C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days. Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablet in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that Cmax, AUC and t1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

Less than 15% (as mean value) of the dose was recovered in the urine as intact solifenacin. The major metabolites identified in urine were N-oxide of solifenacin, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin, and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin and, in feces, 4R-hydroxy solifenacin. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Multiple dose studies of solifenacin succinate tablet in geriatric volunteers (65 to 80 years) showed that Cmax, AUC and t1/2 values of solifenacin were 20-25% higher compared to the younger adult volunteers (18 to 55 years). [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2.1-fold increase in AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in t1/2 of solifenacin in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In studies with solifenacin succinate 10 mg, there was a 2-fold increase in the t1/2 and a 35% increase in AUC of solifenacin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Solifenacin succinate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a crossover study, following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 21 days, the mean C max and AUC of solifenacin increased by 1.5 and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Because solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the concentration of solifenacin. Warfarin In a crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg on the 10th day of dosing with either solifenacin succinate10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 16 days. For R-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max increased by 3% and AUC decreased by 2%. For S-warfarin, when it was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 5% and 1%, respectively. Oral Contraceptives In a crossover study, subjects received 2 cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 150 ug levonorgestrel. During the second cycle, subjects received additional solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 10 days starting from the 12th day of receipt of oral contraceptives. For ethinyl estradiol, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. For levonorgestrel, when it was administered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC decreased by 1%. Digoxin In a crossover study, subjects received digoxin (loading dose of 0.25 mg on day 1, followed by 0.125 mg from days 2 to 8) for 8 days. Consecutively, they received solifenacin succinate 10 mg or matching placebo with digoxin 0.125 mg for an additional 10 days. When digoxin was coadministered with solifenacin succinate, the mean C max and AUC increased by 13% and 4%, respectively. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies demonstrated that, at therapeutic concentrations, solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No increase in tumors was found following the administration of solifenacin succinate to male and female mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 9 times, respectively, of the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 10 mg), and male and female rats for 104 weeks at doses up to 20 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD). Solifenacin succinate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli microbial mutagenicity test or chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation or in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Solifenacin succinate had no effect on reproductive function, fertility, or early embryonic development of the fetus in male and female mice treated with 250 mg/kg/day (13 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate, and in male rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (< 1 times the exposure at the MRHD) and female rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (1.7 times the exposure at the MRHD) of solifenacin succinate. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/ or Pharmacology Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data Dose-related increased mortality without preceding clinical signs occurred in juvenile mice treated before weaning for a duration of 12 weeks, from day 10 after birth, with doses that achieved a pharmacological effect. Animals dosed from postnatal day 10 onwards had higher mortality compared to the mortality in adult mice. No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Solifenacin succinate tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on solifenacin succinate tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg solifenacin succinate tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. The efficacy of solifenacin succinate tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4). The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (1.5; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (1.8; p < 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1). The mean increase in the volume voided per micturition was significantly greater with solifenacin succinate tablets 5 mg (32.3 mL; p < 0.001) and solifenacin succinate tablets 10 mg (42.5 mL; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (8.5 mL). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints in the four individual 12-week clinical studies of solifenacin succinate tablets are reported in Tables 3 through 6.
