      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning to treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates. (5.1, 7.1, 8.6) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected. (5.2) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. (5.7) Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release : Consider the iron content of mesalamine delayed-release in patients taking iron supplementation and those at risk of iron overload. (5.8) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release that contain or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of mesalamine delayed-release-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when mesalamine delayed-release tablets are discontinued. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Mesalamine delayed-release contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release tablets. Each 800 mg delayed-release tablet contains 0.72 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 4.3 mg at the recommended daily dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Before prescribing mesalamine delayed-release to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk for developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including mesalamine delayed-release. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious or clinically significant adverse reactions described elsewhere in labeling are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and worsening of ulcerative colitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablets have been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablets 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine delayed-release tablets 400 mg 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablets and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. The most common reactions reported in the mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg and 618 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablet comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system. Table 1.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts ( see Data ). There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data Human Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 mg/L to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 mg/kg/day to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with mesalamine delayed-release. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine delayed-release is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are a pH dependent product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2,296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet was approximately 24 hours [4 hours to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release tablets is systemically absorbed. Food Effect: A high calorie (800 to 1,000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C max by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC 8-48 and AUC 0-tldc ) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t max by 6 hours (from 24 hours to 30 hours) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Comparative exposure between one mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac-5-ASA. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day mesalamine delayed-release (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person.) Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1,000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 mg/kg/day and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4,000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6,000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 4.8 grams per day was studied in a six-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 772 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablets three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day). Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%). The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the mesalamine delayed-release 4.8 grams group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]). A second controlled study supported the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 grams."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Inform patients that if they are switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release to discontinue their previous oral mesalamine therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release. One mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet is not substitutable for two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products. Inform patients to take mesalamine delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal. Instruct patients to swallow the mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole, taking care not to break, cut, or chew the tablets, because the coating is an important part of the delayed-release formulation. Drink an adequate amount of fluids. Inform patients that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Instruct patients to protect mesalamine delayed-release tablets from moisture. Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine delayed-release may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDs, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) ] . Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they take iron-containing supplements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluaterenal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases ofnephrolithiasishave been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones areradiotransparentand undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment withmesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine delayed-release tablets to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single-Dose Administration of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for Tmax and Tlag. of Mesalamine Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 1.2 g (N=47) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g (N=48) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 9,039 N=43 (5,054) 20,538 (12,980) 41,434 (26,640) AUC 0- (ng\u2219h/mL) 9,578 N=27 (5,214) 21,084 (13,185) 44,775 N=36 (30,302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1,595 (1,484) 2,154 (1,140) T max Median (min, max) (h) 9.0 N=46 (4.0-32.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.0) T lag\u00b6 (h) 2.0# (0-8.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56(6.38) 7.05 N=33 5.54) 7.25 \u00a7 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g with a high-fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574 ) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892 ) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function (5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) \u2022 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine : Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving MESALAMINE SUPPOSITORIES; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.5 , 7.3 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppositories therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are summarized in the Table 1 below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring In More Than 1% of Mesalamine Suppository Treated Patients (Comparison to Placebo) Symptom Mesalamine (n = 177) Placebo (n = 84) N % N % Dizziness 5 3 2 2.4 Rectal Pain 3 1.8 0 0 Fever 2 1.2 0 0 Rash 2 1.2 0 0 Acne 2 1.2 0 0 Colitis 2 1.2 0 0 In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients comparing the mesalamine 1000 mg suppository administered nightly to that of the mesalamine 500 mg suppository twice daily. The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving mesalamine suppositories, the adverse reactions listed below have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories and other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Body as a Whole: drug fever, fatigue, lupus-like syndrome, medication residue \u2022 Cardiac Disorders : myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \u2022 Eye disorders: eye swelling \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, anal pruritus, anorectal discomfort, constipation, feces discolored, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucus stools, nausea, painful defecation, pancreatitis, proctalgia, rectal discharge, rectal tenesmus, stomach discomfort, vomiting \u2022 Hepatic Disorders : cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, jaundice, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes, liver necrosis, liver failure \u2022 Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia \u2022 Neurological/Psychiatric Disorders : Guillain-Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension \u2022 Renal Disorders: interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change nephropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonitis) \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder : alopecia, erythema, erythema nodosum, pruritus, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, urticaria \u2022 Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [see Data] . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5- aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in pediatric patients ages 5 to 17 years is approved for Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s CANASA (mesalamine) rectal suppositories. However, due to Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppositories therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Although the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease is uncertain, both prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators of mucosal injury and inflammation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction: Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Interference With Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u2264 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6 Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Administration Instruct patients: \u2022 Swallow mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole; do not split or crush. \u2022 Take mesalamine delayed-release tablets with food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. \u2022 Urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). \u2022 Drink an adequate amount of fluids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. \u2022 Intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool and contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction: Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4 Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single-Dose Administration of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Under Fasting Conditions * Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for T max and T lag . \u2020 N=43, \u2021 N=27, \u00a7 N=36, \u00b6 Median (min, max), # N=46, \u00de N =33 Parameter * of Mesalamine Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 1.2 g (N=47) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g (N=48) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng.h/mL) 9039 \u2020 (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng.h/mL) 9578 \u2021 (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 \u00a7 (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max \u00b6 (h) 9 # (4 to 32.1) 12 (4 to 34.1) 12 (4 to 34) T lag \u00b6 (h) 2 # (0 to 8) 2 (1 to 4) 2 (1 to 4) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 \u2021 (6.38) 7.05 \u00de (5.54) 7.25 \u00a7 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g with a high-fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104 week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2400 mg/kg in mice and 1150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u2264 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6 Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Mesalamine Rectal Suspension, USP Enema, a disposable (60 mL) unit, is mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The empirical formula is C 7 H 7 NO 3 , representing a molecular weight of 153.14. The structural formula is: Each rectal suspension enema unit contains 4 grams of mesalamine. In addition to mesalamine the preparation contains the inactive ingredients carbomer 934P, edetate disodium, potassium acetate, potassium metabisulfite, purified water and xanthan gum. Sodium benzoate is added as a preservative. The disposable unit consists of an applicator tip protected by a polyethylene cover and lubricated with USP white petrolatum. The unit has a one-way valve to prevent back flow of the dispensed product. Structural Formula Image"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Each mesalamine rectal suspension enema delivers up to 4 g of mesalamine to the left side of the colon. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Preclinical Toxicology - Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of > 214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred. The human dose of 4 grams represents approximately 80 mg/kg but when mesalamine is given rectally as a suspension, absorption is poor and limited to the distal colon (see Pharmacokinetics ). Overt renal toxicity has not been observed (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS ), but the potential must be considered. Pharmacokinetics - Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 h), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours [U. Klotz, Clin. Pharmacokin. 10:285-302 (1985)]. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either free or metabolized drug during repeated daily administrations. Efficacy - In a placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial of 153 patients with active distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis or proctitis, mesalamine rectal suspension enema reduced the overall disease activity index (DAI) and individual components as follows: EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON SEVERITY OF DISEASE DATA FROM U.S.-CANADA TRIAL COMBINED RESULTS OF EIGHT CENTERS Activity Indices, mean N Baseline Day 22 End Point Change Baseline to End Point * Overall DAI Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 76 7.42 4.05 \u2020 3.37 \u2021 -55.07% \u2021 Placebo 77 7.40 6.03 5.83 -21.58% Stool Frequency Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.58 1.11 \u00a7 1.01 \u2020 -0.57 \u00a7 Placebo 1.92 1.47 1.50 -0.41 Rectal Bleeding Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.82 0.59 \u2021 0.51 \u2021 -1.30 \u2021 Placebo 1.73 1.21 1.11 -0.61 Mucosal Inflammation Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 2.17 1.22 \u2020 0.96 \u2021 -1.21 \u2020 Placebo 2.18 1.74 1.61 -0.56 Physician's Assessment of Disease Severity Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.86 1.13 \u2021 0.88 \u2021 -0.97 \u2021 Placebo 1.87 1.62 1.55 -0.30 Each parameter has a 4-point scale with a numerical rating: 0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. Drug Interactions Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine rectal suspension enema and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. Information for Patients - See patient instructions enclosed. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility - Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a 2-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet. Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no effects in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange at doses up to 610 mg/kg. No effects on fertility were observed in rats receiving up to 320 mg/kg/day. The oligospermia and infertility in men associated with sulfasalazine has very rarely been reported among patients treated with mesalamine. Pregnancy - Teratologic studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to five and eight times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women for either sulfasalazine or 5-ASA. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, 5-ASA should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether mesalamine or its metabolite(s) are excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema, especially if used concomitantly with anticoagulants. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema.

In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema."

Cases of pancreatitis and fibrosing alveolitis have been reported as manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease as well. Published case reports and/or spontaneous post marketing surveillance have described rare instances of aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, oligospermia, and infertility in men. Anemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis can be part of the clinical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease. Postmarketing cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP) and pleurisy/pleuritis have been reported. Hair Loss Mild hair loss characterized by \"more hair in the comb\" but no withdrawal from clinical trials has been observed in seven of 815 mesalamine patients but none of the placebo-treated patients. In the literature there are at least six additional patients with mild hair loss who received either mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Retreatment is not always associated with repeated hair loss."

      "OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine absorption from the colon is limited; however, mesalamine rectal suspension enema is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult dosage of mesalamine rectal suspension enema in 60 mL units is one rectal instillation (4 grams) once a day, preferably at bedtime, and retained for approximately eight hours. While the effect of mesalamine rectal suspension enema may be seen within 3 to 21 days, the usual course of therapy would be from 3 to 6 weeks depending on symptoms and sigmoidoscopic findings. Studies available to date have not assessed if mesalamine rectal suspension enema will modify relapse rates after the 6-week short-term treatment. Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is for rectal use only. Drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment. Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well to make sure the suspension is homogeneous. The patient should remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. Holding the bottle at the neck will not cause any of the medication to be discharged. The position most often used is obtained by lying on the left side (to facilitate migration into the sigmoid colon); with the lower leg extended and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. An alternative is the knee-chest position. The applicator tip should be gently inserted in the rectum pointing toward the umbilicus. A steady squeezing of the bottle will discharge most of the preparation. The preparation should be taken at bedtime with the objective of retaining it all night. Patient instructions are included with every seven units."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis : Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo. in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0\u201324 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0\u201324 (mcg*h/mL) 11\u00b15 17\u00b16 AUC 0\u2013inf (mcg*h/mL) 14\u00b15 \u2013 C max (mcg/mL) 2.1\u00b11.1 2.7\u00b11.1 T max (h) a 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 9\u00b17 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0\u201324 (mcg*h/mL) 26\u00b16 37\u00b19 AUC 0\u2013inf (mcg*h/mL) 51\u00b123 \u2013 C max (mcg/mL) 2.8\u00b10.8 3.4\u00b10.9 T max (h) a 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 12\u00b111 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2\u00d70.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician's rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u22651 and mucosal appearance score \u22652, or premature withdrawal from study.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets : Consider the iron content of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients taking iron supplementation and those at risk of iron overload. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of mesalamine delayed-release-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when mesalamine delayed-release tablets are discontinued. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Mesalamine delayed-release tablets contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release tablets. Each 800 mg delayed-release tablet contains 0.5001 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 3.0006 mg at the recommended daily dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Before prescribing mesalamine delayed-release to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk for developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including mesalamine delayed-release. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA).

Mesalamine delayed-release has been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing mesalamine delayed-release 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine-delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release (800 mg) tablets and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release (400 mg) tablets. The most common reactions reported in the mesalamine delayed-release group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release and 618 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system. Table 1.

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose ( see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data Human Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 mg/L to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 mg/kg/day to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine\u00adcontaining products such as mesalamine delayed-release. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with mesalamine delayed-release. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet was approximately 24 hours [4 to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release tablets is systemically absorbed. Food Effect: A high calorie (800 to 1,000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C max by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC 8-48 and AUC 0-tldc ) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t max by 6 hours (from 24 to 30 hours) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Comparative exposure between one mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac-5\u00adASA. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces."

These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day mesalamine delayed-release dose (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person.) Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1,000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4,000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6,000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose)."

Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the mesalamine delayed-release 4.8 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release tablets three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day). Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%). The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the mesalamine delayed-release group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]). A second controlled study supported the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine delayed-release."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] Inform patients that if they are switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release tablets to discontinue their previous oral mesalamine therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release tablets. One mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet is not substitutable for two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products. Inform patients to take mesalamine delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal. Instruct patients to swallow the mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole, taking care not to break, cut, or chew the tablets, because the coating is an important part of the delayed-release formulation. Drink an adequate amount of fluids . Inform patients that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Instruct patients to protect mesalamine delayed-release tablets from moisture. Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine delayed-release tablets may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDS, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they take iron-containing supplements [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet) Manufactured for: AvKARE Pulaski, TN 38478 Mfg.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

Maintenance of Remission A mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage of 2.4 g/day, administered as either 1.2 g twice daily or 2.4 g once daily, was evaluated for safety in three maintenance trials in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a 6-month double-blind, active-controlled study (Study 3) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] and two 12- to 14-month open-label studies. The most common adverse reactions with mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these maintenance trials are listed in Table 3.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine delayed-release tablets to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\uf0d7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574 ) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892 ) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of LIALDA in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue LIALDA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue LIALDA if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using LIALDA in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as LIALDA that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of LIALDA therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using LIALDA in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue LIALDA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with LIALDA. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to LIALDA tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue LIALDA if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using LIALDA in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue LIALDA at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of LIALDA, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid LIALDA in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with LIALDA. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of LIALDA may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

Maintenance of Remission A LIALDA dosage of 2.4 g/day, administered as either 1.2 g twice daily or 2.4 g once daily, was evaluated for safety in three maintenance trials in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a 6-month double-blind, active-controlled study (Study 3) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] and two 12- to 14-month open-label studies. The most common adverse reactions with LIALDA in these maintenance trials are listed in Table 3.

The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of adults. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of pediatric patients treated with LIALDA were: abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LIALDA or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of LIALDA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LIALDA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from LIALDA or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LIALDA have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of LIALDA in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety and effectiveness of LIALDA have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of LIALDA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as LIALDA compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with LIALDA. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing LIALDA. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on LIALDA therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue LIALDA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from LIALDA 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of LIALDA 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, LIALDA 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g LIALDA. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of LIALDA, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single-Dose Administration of LIALDA Under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for T max and T lag . of Mesalamine LIALDA 1.2 g (N=47) LIALDA 2.4 g (N=48) LIALDA 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 9039 N=43, (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u2219h/mL) 9578 N=27, (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 N=36, (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max Median (min, max), (h) 9.0 N=46, (4.0-32.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.0) T lag (h) 2.0 (0-8.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 (6.38) 7.05 N=33 (5.54) 7.25 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of LIALDA 4.8 g with a high-fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. LIALDA was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of LIALDA 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of LIALDA (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with LIALDA were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with LIALDA. Coadministration of LIALDA did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from LIALDA 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of LIALDA 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, LIALDA 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g LIALDA. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of LIALDA, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single-Dose Administration of LIALDA Under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for T max and T lag . of Mesalamine LIALDA 1.2 g (N=47) LIALDA 2.4 g (N=48) LIALDA 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 9039 N=43, (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u2219h/mL) 9578 N=27, (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 N=36, (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max Median (min, max), (h) 9.0 N=46, (4.0-32.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.1) 12.0 (4.0-34.0) T lag (h) 2.0 (0-8.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) 2.0 (1.0-4.0) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 (6.38) 7.05 N=33 (5.54) 7.25 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of LIALDA 4.8 g with a high-fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. LIALDA was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of LIALDA 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of LIALDA (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with LIALDA were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with LIALDA. Coadministration of LIALDA did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, mesalamine at doses up to 2500 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of LIALDA. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of LIALDA.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used LIALDA dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the LIALDA treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the LIALDA dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both LIALDA dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both LIALDA dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) LIALDA 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) LIALDA 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LIALDA 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using LIALDA 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of LIALDA. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of LIALDA in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of LIALDA in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended LIALDA dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended LIALDA dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended LIALDA dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended LIALDA dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended LIALDA dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended LIALDA dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 , 13.2 ) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment; discontinue treatment, if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions , including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules, if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failur e : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Iron Content of MESALAMINE d elayed- r elease c apsules : Consider the iron content of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in patients taking iron supplementation and those at risk of iron overload. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules and periodically while on therapy. Discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risk and benefits of using MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5. 5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5. 6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5. 7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. 5. 8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Capsules MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release capsules. Each 400 mg delayed-release capsule contains 2.7 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 16.4 mg at the maximum recommended daily dosage in adults [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Before prescribing MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk of developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. 5. 9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions seen in MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) are: A dults : eructation, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, rhinitis, back pain, and rash. ( 6.1 ) P ediatric s : nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, sinusitis, rash, cough and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC at 1-877-446-3679 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In total, mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets have been evaluated in 2690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials. Below is a description of the adverse reactions of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Clinical studies supporting mesalamine delayed-release tablets use for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Studies 1 and 2), and one 6-week, randomized, double-blind, study of 2 dosage levels in children with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Study 3). Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis included a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study (Study 4) and four active-controlled maintenance trials comparing mesalamine delayed-release with sulfasalazine. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been evaluated in 427 adults and 107 children with ulcerative colitis in these controlled studies. Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 of whom were randomized to mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 4% of the mesalamine delayed release tablets -treated patients in 2.4 grams per day group discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions as compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of patients was 41 years and 49 % of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from mesalamine delayed-release tablets included (each in one patient): diarrhea and colitis flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below. Table 2. Most Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Study 1 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Adults* Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Mesalamine Delayed release 2.4 grams per day Placebo (n = 53) (n = 52) Eructation 26 19 Abdominal pain 21 12 Constipation 11 0 Dizziness 9 8 Rhinitis 8 6 Back pain 6 4 Rash 6 4 Dyspepsia 4 0 Flu syndrome 4 2 * At Least 2% of Patients in the Mesalamine Delayed Release Tablets Group and at a Rate Greater than Placebo Pediatric Patients 5 to 17 Years Old A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of 2 dosage levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were divided by body weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective body weight category) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not found to be more effective than the recommended low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Duration of exposure to mesalamine among the 82 patients in the study ranged from 12 to 50 days (mean of 40 days in each dosage group). The majority (88%) of patients in each group were treated for more than 5 weeks. Table 3 provides a summary of the specific reported adverse reactions. Table 3 . Adverse Reactions \u2265 5% Reported in Study 3 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Pediatric Patients* Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Low Dosage High Dosage (n=41) (n=41) Nasopharyngitis 15 12 Headache 10 5 Abdominal pain 10 2 Dizziness 7 2 Sinusitis 7 0 Rash 5 5 Cough 5 0 Diarrhea 5 0 Fatigue 2 10 Pyrexia 0 7 Increased Lipase 0 5 Low Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 1.2 to 2.4 grams/day; High Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 2.0 to 4.8 grams/day. Dosage was dependent on body weight. Adverse Reactions reported at the 1-week telephone follow-up visit are included. * At Least 5% of Patients in the low dosage or high dosage group Twelve percent of the patients in the low dosage group (5 patients) and 2% of the patients in the high dosage group (1 patient) had serious adverse reactions. The serious adverse reactions consisted of sinusitis, adenovirus infection, and pancreatitis in one patient each in the low dosage group. Abdominal pain and decreased body mass index occurred in one patient and bloody diarrhea and sclerosing cholangitis also occurred in one patient in the low dosage group. Anemia and syncope occurred in one patient in the high dosage group. Five patients were withdrawn from the study due to adverse reactions: 3 (7%) in the low dosage group (1 patient each with adenovirus infection, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis) and 2 patients (5%) in the high dosage group (1 patient with increased amylase and increased lipase, and 1 patient with upper abdominal pain). In general, the nature and severity of reactions in the pediatric population was similar to those reported in adult populations of patients with ulcerative colitis. Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults included a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . In Study 4, a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration, 87 patients were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed release tablets 1.6 grams per/day compared to 87 patients randomized to placebo. The average age of patients in Study 4 was 42 years and 55% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal in patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets included (each in one patient): anxiety, stomatitis and asthenia. In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 2, the following occurred at a frequency of 2% or greater in patients who received mesalamine delayed-release tablets in Study 4: abdominal enlargement, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infection, joint disorder, nervousness, paresthesia, hemorrhoids, tenesmus, urinary frequency and vision abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Neck pain, facial edema, edema, lupus-like syndrome, drug fever. Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, pancreatitis, gastritis, increased appetite, cholecystitis, dry mouth, oral ulcers, perforated peptic ulcer, bloody diarrhea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well controlled studies of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules use in pregnant women. Limited published human data on mesalamine show no increase in the overall rate of congenital malformations. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight; however, these adverse pregnancy outcomes are also associated with active inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, all pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. No evidence of fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose. MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Human Data Mesalamine crosses the placenta. In prospective and retrospective studies of over 600 women exposed to mesalamine during pregnancy, the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the background rate in the general population. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight, but it is unclear whether this was due to underlying maternal disease, drug exposure, or both, as active inflammatory bowel disease is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Animal data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose, based on body surface area. 8. 2 Lactation Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing experience suggest a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) in subjects receiving mesalamine delayed-release tablets who are 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] ."

Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Approximately 28% of mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release formulation is absorbed after oral ingestion. Following replicate single dose oral administration of MESALAMINE delayed-release 400 mg capsule containing four 100 mg tablets in healthy subjects (N = 146) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48 and AUC tldc values were 150 \u00b1 235 ng/mL, 640 \u00b1 521 ng.h/mL, and 909 \u00b1 777 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following MESALAMINE delayed-release 400 mg capsule containing four 100 mg tablets was approximately 10 hours [5.5 \u2013 48 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. A high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (geometric mean C max : \u2191 32%; AUC 8-48 h : \u2191 46%; AUC: \u2191 29%) and delayed the median t max by approximately 4 hours compared to results in the fasted state. The observed differences in mesalamine exposure due to concomitant food intake are not considered to be clinically relevant at the total daily dosage of 2.4 grams per day. Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is rapidly acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces. After intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is reported to be approximately 40 minutes. After oral dosing, the median terminal t 1/2 values for mesalamine are usually about 25 hours, but are variable, ranging from 1.5 to 296 hours. There is a large inter-subject and intra-subject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and in their terminal half-lives following administration of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study evaluating 30, 60 and 90 mg/kg per day doses of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets administered twice daily for four weeks, the mean C avg values of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients ranged from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL based on data from all dose levels. In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level (that is, 1.2, 2 or 2.4 grams/day based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of MESALAMINE delayed-release capsules has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults. 14.1 Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n=53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n=53), compared to placebo (n=52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient\u2019s functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets showed an improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048). In addition, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day group showed improvement in rectal bleeding and stool frequency. The 1.6 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because it did not produce consistent evidence of effectiveness [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. In a second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 87 patients (Study 2), patients received mesalamine delayed release tablets of 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n=11) and 4.8 grams per day (1.2 grams four times a day; n=38), compared to placebo four times a day (n=38). mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day for 6 weeks resulted in sigmoidoscopic improvement in 28 of 38 (74%) patients compared to 10 of 38 (26%) placebo patients (p less than 0.001). Also, more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day group than the placebo group showed improvement in overall symptoms. The 4.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because greater efficacy was not demonstrated with this dosage compared to the 2.4 grams per day dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Pediatrics The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed release in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age for treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis are supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed release in adults and a single study in pediatric patients. A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of two dosage levels of mesalamine delayed release tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly or moderately active ulcerative colitis defined as a score of 10 to 55 on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) (which includes assessment of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, number of stools per 24 hours, presence of nocturnal bowel movement and activity level, and has a total maximum score of 85; each of the subscales are scored from 0 to 10 except rectal bleeding which is scored from 0 to 30, and number of stools per 24 hours which is scored from 0 to 15) and rectal bleeding and stool frequency Mayo subscale scores of \u22651 (each of these subscales are scored from zero (normal) to three (most severe). All patients were divided by weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective weight category) or a high dosage (2, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). Doses were administered every 12 hours. The proportion of patients who achieved success based on the Truncated Mayo Score (TM-Mayo) (based on the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores of the Mayo Score) and based on the PUCAI was measured after 6 weeks of treatment. Success based on TM-Mayo was defined as either partial response (improvement from baseline in stool frequency or rectal bleeding subscores with no worsening in the other) or complete response (both stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores equal 0). Success based on PUCAI was defined as either partial response (PUCAI reduction of greater than or equal to 20 points from Baseline to Week 6 with Week 6 score greater than or equal to 10) or complete response (PUCAI less than 10 at Week 6). There were 41 patients in the low dosage group and 41 patients in the high dosage group who received at least one dose of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets; 36 patients in each dosage group completed the study. Patients were considered treatment failures if they did not achieve success or dropped out due to adverse reaction or lack of efficacy. At Week 6, 73% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 70% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the TM-Mayo; 34% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. At Week 6, 56% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 55% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the PUCAI; 46% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not more effective than the low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 14.2 Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4), patients received mesalamine delayed-release tablets of 0.8 grams per day (400 mg twice a day; n = 90) and 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n = 87), compared to placebo four times a day (n = 87). The proportion of patients treated with 0.8 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission was not statistically significant compared to placebo; the 0.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The number of patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.6 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis was 61 of 87 (70%) compared with 42 of 87 (48%) of placebo patients (p = 0.005). A pooled efficacy analysis of 4 maintenance trials compared mesalamine delayed release tablets at dosages of 0.8 to 2.8 grams per day, in divided doses ranging from twice daily to four times per day, with sulfasalazine, at dosages of 2 to 4 grams per day. Treatment success was seen in 59 of 98 (59%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets and 70 of 102 (69%) patients using sulfasalazine, a non-significant difference."

The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Preclinical Toxicology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral > 900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of > 214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman\u2019s capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred. The human dose of 4 grams represents approximately 80 mg/kg but when mesalamine is given rectally as a suspension, absorption is poor and limited to the distal colon (see Pharmacokinetics ). Overt renal toxicity has not been observed (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS ), but the potential must be considered. Pharmacokinetics Mesalamine administered rectally as Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 \u03bcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 h), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours [U. Klotz, Clin. Pharmacokin . 10:285-302 (1985)]. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either free or metabolized drug during repeated daily administrations. Efficacy In a placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial of 153 patients with active distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis or proctitis, Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema reduced the overall disease activity index (DAI) and individual components as follows: EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON SEVERITY OF DISEASE DATA FROM U.S.-CANADA TRIAL COMBINED RESULTS OF EIGHT CENTERS Activity Indices, mean N Baseline Day 22 End Point Change Baseline to End Point* Overall DAI Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 76 7.42 4.05\u2020 3.37\u2021 -55.07%\u2021 Placebo 77 7.40 6.03 5.83 -21.58% Stool Frequency Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.58 1.11\u00a7 1.01\u2020 -0.57\u00a7 Placebo 1.92 1.47 1.50 -0.41 Rectal Bleeding Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.82 0.59\u2021 0.51\u2021 -1.30\u2021 Placebo 1.73 1.21 1.11 -0.61 Mucosal Inflammation Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 2.17 1.22\u2020 0.96\u2021 -1.21\u2020 Placebo 2.18 1.74 1.61 -0.56 Physician's Assessment of Disease Severity Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.86 1.13\u2021 0.88\u2021 -0.97\u2021 Placebo 1.87 1.62 1.55 -0.30 Each parameter has a 4-point scale with a numerical rating: 0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema therapy. Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in patients with known liver impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. Information for Patients Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. Drug Interactions Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a 2-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet. Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no effects in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange at doses up to 610 mg/kg. No effects on fertility were observed in rats receiving up to 320 mg/kg/day. The oligospermia and infertility in men associated with sulfasalazine has very rarely been reported among patients treated with mesalamine. Pregnancy Teratologic studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to five and eight times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women for either sulfasalazine or 5-ASA. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, 5-ASA should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether mesalamine or its metabolite(s) are excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema, especially if used concomitantly with anticoagulants. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema.

      "OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine absorption from the colon is limited; however, Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult dosage of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in 60 mL units is one rectal instillation (4 grams) once a day, preferably at bedtime, and retained for approximately eight hours. While the effect of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema may be seen within 3 to 21 days, the usual course of therapy would be from 3 to 6 weeks depending on symptoms and sigmoidoscopic findings. Studies available to date have not assessed if Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema will modify relapse rates after the 6-week short-term treatment. Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is for rectal use only. Drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment. Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well to make sure the suspension is homogeneous. The patient should remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. Holding the bottle at the neck will not cause any of the medication to be discharged. The position most often used is obtained by lying on the left side (to facilitate migration into the sigmoid colon); with the lower leg extended and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. An alternative is the knee-chest position. The applicator tip should be gently inserted in the rectum pointing toward the umbilicus. A steady squeezing of the bottle will discharge most of the preparation. The preparation should be taken at bedtime with the objective of retaining it all night. Patient instructions are included with every seven units."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine- Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. (5.7) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules -treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions* in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% *Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder: alopecia Gastrointestinal: lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities: increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders: fatigue Hepatic: hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders : creatinine clearance decreased, hematuri a Musculoskeletal : pain, arthralgia Respiratory : dyspnea 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mesalamine extended- release capsule or other mesalamine\u00ad containing products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsule in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 11 \u00b1 5 14 \u00b1 5 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 4 (2, 16) 9 \u00b1 7 17 \u00b1 6 - 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 4 (2, 8) 10 \u00b1 8 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 26 \u00b1 6 51 \u00b1 23 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 4 (4, 12) 12 \u00b1 11 37 \u00b1 9 - 3.4 \u00b1 0.9 5 (2, 8) 14 \u00b1 10 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended- release capsule, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free* Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Maintenance Studies Mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.) P-value Study 1 68% (143/209) 51% (49/96) 17% (5.5, 29.2) <0.001 Study 2 71% (117/164) 59% (55/93) 12% (0, 24.5) 0.046 * Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u2265 1 and mucosal appearance score \u2265 2, or premature withdrawal from study. Examination of gender subgroups did not identify difference in response to mesalamine extended-release capsules among these subgroups. There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations. The use of mesalamine extended-release capsules for treating ulcerative colitis beyond six months has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials."

Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ), to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics was evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ), to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2219hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics was evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic.

Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablet dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablet treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablet dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. (5.1, 7.2, 8.6) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. (5.7) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary Normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Discontinue mesalamine at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] \u2022 Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] \u2022 Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Most common adverse reactions (\u22653%) are: headache, diarrhea, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and nasopharyngitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions* in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% * Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder : alopecia Gastrointestinal : lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities : increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders : fatigue Hepatic : hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders : creatinine clearance decreased, hematuria Musculoskeletal : pain, arthralgia Respiratory : dyspnea 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mesalamine or other mesalaminecontaining products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole : lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiovascular : pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic : jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic : agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Nervous System : intracranial hypertension Neurological/Psychiatric : peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis Renal and Urinary : nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change disease, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7)] Respiratory/Pulmonary : eosinophilic pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, pleurisy/pleuritis Skin : psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Renal/Urogenital : reversible oligospermia"

(7.3) 7.1 Antacids Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in mesalamine extended-release capsules depends on pH, avoid co-administration of mesalamine extended-release capsules with antacids [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . 7.2 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.4 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 11\u00b15 14\u00b15 2.1\u00b11.1 4 (2, 16) 9\u00b17 17\u00b16 - 2.7\u00b11.1 4 (2, 8) 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 26\u00b16 51\u00b123 2.8\u00b10.8 4 (4, 12) 12\u00b111 37\u00b19 - 3.4\u00b10.9 5 (2, 8) 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, Tmax for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect Cmax for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 11\u00b15 14\u00b15 2.1\u00b11.1 4 (2, 16) 9\u00b17 17\u00b16 - 2.7\u00b11.1 4 (2, 8) 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 26\u00b16 51\u00b123 2.8\u00b10.8 4 (4, 12) 12\u00b111 37\u00b19 - 3.4\u00b10.9 5 (2, 8) 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, Tmax for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect Cmax for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free* Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Maintenance Studies Mesalamine 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.)

Examination of gender subgroups did not identify difference in response to mesalamine among these subgroups. There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations. The use of mesalamine for treating ulcerative colitis beyond six months has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction: Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Azathioprine and 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4 Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single-Dose Administration of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Under Fasting Conditions * Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for T max and T lag . \u2020 N=43, \u2021 N=27, \u00a7 N=36, \u00b6 Median (min, max), # N=46, \u00de N =33 Parameter * of Mesalamine Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 1.2 g (N=47) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g (N=48) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng.h/mL) 9039 \u2020 (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng.h/mL) 9578 \u2021 (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 \u00a7 (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max \u00b6 (h) 9 # (4 to 32.1) 12 (4 to 34.1) 12 (4 to 34) T lag \u00b6 (h) 2 # (0 to 8) 2 (1 to 4) 2 (1 to 4) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 \u2021 (6.38) 7.05 \u00de (5.54) 7.25 \u00a7 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g with a high-fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was co-administered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104 week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2400 mg/kg in mice and 1150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u2264 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6 Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n = 367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n = 190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. * Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder: alopecia Gastrointestinal: lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities: increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders: fatigue Hepatic: hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders: creatinine clearance decreased, hematuria Musculoskeletal: pain, arthralgia Respiratory: dyspnea table1 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mesalamine extended-release capsules or other mesalamine-containing products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole : lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiovascular : pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic : jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic : agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Nervous System : intracranial hypertension Neurological/Psychiatric : peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis Renal and Urinary : nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change disease, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.7) ] \u2022 Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. a Media (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . table2 Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. a Media (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . table2 Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u2265 1 and mucosal appearance score \u2265 2, or premature withdrawal from study.

( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release capsules and periodically while on therapy. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risk and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Capsules Mesalamine delayed-release capsules contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release capsules. Each 400 mg delayed-release capsule contains 0.589 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 3.54 mg at the maximum recommended daily dosage in adults [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Before prescribing mesalamine delayed-release capsules to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk of developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions seen in mesalamine clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) are: Adults: eructation, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, rhinitis, back pain, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Pediatrics: nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, sinusitis, rash, cough and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of mesalamine has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In total, mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets have been evaluated in 2690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials. Below is a description of the adverse reactions of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Clinical studies supporting mesalamine delayed-release tablets use for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Studies 1 and 2), and one 6-week, randomized, double-blind, study of 2 dosage levels in children with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Study 3). Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis included a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study (Study 4) and four active-controlled maintenance trials comparing mesalamine delayed-release with sulfasalazine. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been evaluated in 427 adults and 107 children with ulcerative colitis in these controlled studies. Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 of whom were randomized to mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )], 4% of the mesalamine delayed release tablets-treated patients in 2.4 grams per day group discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions as compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of patients was 41 years and 49% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from mesalamine delayed-release tablets included (each in one patient): diarrhea and colitis flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below. Table 2. Most Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Study 1 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Adults* Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Mesalamine Delayed-Release 2.4 grams per day Placebo (n = 53) (n = 52) Eructation 26 19 Abdominal pain 21 12 Constipation 11 0 Dizziness 9 8 Rhinitis 8 6 Back pain 6 4 Rash 6 4 Dyspepsia 4 0 Flu syndrome 4 2 * At Least 2% of Patients in the Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Group and at a Rate Greater than Placebo Pediatric Patients 5 to 17 Years Old A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of 2 dosage levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were divided by body weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective body weight category) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not found to be more effective than the recommended low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Duration of exposure to mesalamine among the 82 patients in the study ranged from 12 to 50 days (mean of 40 days in each dosage group). The majority (88%) of patients in each group were treated for more than 5 weeks. Table 3 provides a summary of the specific reported adverse reactions. Table 3. Adverse Reactions \u2265 5% Reported in Study 3 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Pediatric Patients* Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Low Dosage High Dosage (n=41) (n=41) Nasopharyngitis 15 12 Headache 10 5 Abdominal pain 10 2 Dizziness 7 2 Sinusitis 7 0 Rash 5 5 Cough 5 0 Diarrhea 5 0 Fatigue 2 10 Pyrexia 0 7 Increased Lipase 0 5 Low Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 1.2 to 2.4 grams/day; High Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 2.0 to 4.8 grams/day. Dosage was dependent on body weight. Adverse Reactions reported at the 1-week telephone follow-up visit are included. * At Least 5% of Patients in the low dosage or high dosage group Twelve percent of the patients in the low dosage group (5 patients) and 2% of the patients in the high dosage group (1 patient) had serious adverse reactions. The serious adverse reactions consisted of sinusitis, adenovirus infection, and pancreatitis in one patient each in the low dosage group. Abdominal pain and decreased body mass index occurred in one patient and bloody diarrhea and sclerosing cholangitis also occurred in one patient in the low dosage group. Anemia and syncope occurred in one patient in the high dosage group. Five patients were withdrawn from the study due to adverse reactions: 3 (7%) in the low dosage group (1 patient each with adenovirus infection, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis) and 2 patients (5%) in the high dosage group (1 patient with increased amylase and increased lipase, and 1 patient with upper abdominal pain). In general, the nature and severity of reactions in the pediatric population was similar to those reported in adult populations of patients with ulcerative colitis. Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults included a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . In Study 4, a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration, 87 patients were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed release tablets 1.6 grams per /day compared to 87 patients randomized to placebo. The average age of patients in Study 4 was 42 years and 55% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal in patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets included (each in one patient): anxiety, stomatitis and asthenia. In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 2, the following occurred at a frequency of 2% or greater in patients who received mesalamine delayed-release tablets in Study 4: abdominal enlargement, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infection, joint disorder, nervousness, paresthesia, hemorrhoids, tenesmus, urinary frequency and vision abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Neck pain, facial edema, edema, lupus-like syndrome, drug fever. Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, pancreatitis, gastritis, increased appetite, cholecystitis, dry mouth, oral ulcers, perforated peptic ulcer, bloody diarrhea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine use in pregnant women. Limited published human data on mesalamine show no increase in the overall rate of congenital malformations. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight; however, these adverse pregnancy outcomes are also associated with active inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, all pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. No evidence of fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose. Mesalamine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Human Data Mesalamine crosses the placenta. In prospective and retrospective studies of over 600 women exposed to mesalamine during pregnancy, the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the background rate in the general population. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight, but it is unclear whether this was due to underlying maternal disease, drug exposure, or both, as active inflammatory bowel disease is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Animal data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 mg/L to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 mg/kg/day to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when mesalamine delayed-release capsules are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing experience suggest a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) in subjects receiving mesalamine delayed-release tablets who are 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing experience suggest a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) in subjects receiving mesalamine delayed-release tablets who are 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine delayed-release capsules is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release capsules is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Approximately 28% of mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release formulation is absorbed after oral ingestion. Following replicate single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules containing four 100 mg tablets in healthy subjects (N = 146) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48 and AUC tldc values were 150 \u00b1 235 ng/mL, 640 \u00b1 521 ng.h/mL, and 909 \u00b1 777 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules containing four 100 mg tablets was approximately 10 hours [5.5 to 48 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. A high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (geometric mean C max : \u2191 32%; AUC 8-48 h: \u2191 46%; AUC: \u2191 29%) and delayed the median t max by approximately 4 hours compared to results in the fasted state. The observed differences in mesalamine exposure due to concomitant food intake are not considered to be clinically relevant at the total daily dosage of 2.4 grams per day. Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is rapidly acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces. After intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is reported to be approximately 40 minutes. After oral dosing, the median terminal t 1/2 values for mesalamine are usually about 25 hours, but are variable, ranging from 1.5 to 296 hours. There is a large inter-subject and intra-subject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and in their terminal half-lives following administration of mesalamine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study evaluating 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg per day doses of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets administered twice daily for four weeks, the mean C avg values of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients ranged from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL based on data from all dose levels. In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level (that is, 1.2, 2 or 2.4 grams/day based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of mesalamine has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults. 14.1 Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n=53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n=53), compared to placebo (n=52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient\u2019s functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets showed an improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048). In addition, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day group showed improvement in rectal bleeding and stool frequency. The 1.6 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because it did not produce consistent evidence of effectiveness [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . In a second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 87 patients (Study 2), patients received mesalamine delayed release tablets of 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n=11) and 4.8 grams per day (1.2 grams four times a day; n=38), compared to placebo four times a day (n=38). Mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day for 6 weeks resulted in sigmoidoscopic improvement in 28 of 38 (74%) patients compared to 10 of 38 (26%) placebo patients (p less than 0.001). Also, more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day group than the placebo group showed improvement in overall symptoms. The 4.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because greater efficacy was not demonstrated with this dosage compared to the 2.4 grams per day dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Pediatrics The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed release in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age for treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis are supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed release in adults and a single study in pediatric patients. A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of two dosage levels of mesalamine delayed release tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly or moderately active ulcerative colitis defined as a score of 10 to 55 on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) (which includes assessment of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, number of stools per 24 hours, presence of nocturnal bowel movement and activity level, and has a total maximum score of 85; each of the subscales are scored from 0 to 10 except rectal bleeding which is scored from 0 to 30, and number of stools per 24 hours which is scored from 0 to 15) and rectal bleeding and stool frequency Mayo subscale scores of \u22651 (each of these subscales are scored from zero (normal) to three (most severe). All patients were divided by weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective weight category) or a high dosage (2, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). Doses were administered every 12 hours. The proportion of patients who achieved success based on the Truncated Mayo Score (TM-Mayo) (based on the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores of the Mayo Score) and based on the PUCAI was measured after 6 weeks of treatment. Success based on TM-Mayo was defined as either partial response (improvement from baseline in stool frequency or rectal bleeding subscores with no worsening in the other) or complete response (both stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores equal 0). Success based on PUCAI was defined as either partial response (PUCAI reduction of greater than or equal to 20 points from Baseline to Week 6 with Week 6 score greater than or equal to 10) or complete response (PUCAI less than 10 at Week 6). There were 41 patients in the low dosage group and 41 patients in the high dosage group who received at least one dose of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets; 36 patients in each dosage group completed the study. Patients were considered treatment failures if they did not achieve success or dropped out due to adverse reaction or lack of efficacy. At Week 6, 73% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 70% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the TM-Mayo; 34% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. At Week 6, 56% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 55% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the PUCAI; 46% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not more effective than the low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 14.2 Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4), patients received mesalamine delayed-release tablets of 0.8 grams per day (400 mg twice a day; n = 90) and 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n = 87), compared to placebo four times a day (n = 87). The proportion of patients treated with 0.8 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission was not statistically significant compared to placebo; the 0.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The number of patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.6 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis was 61 of 87 (70%) compared with 42 of 87 (48%) of placebo patients (p = 0.005). A pooled efficacy analysis of 4 maintenance trials compared mesalamine delayed release tablets at dosages of 0.8 to 2.8 grams per day, in divided doses ranging from twice daily to four times per day, with sulfasalazine, at dosages of 2 to 4 grams per day. Treatment success was seen in 59 of 98 (59%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets and 70 of 102 (69%) patients using sulfasalazine, a non-significant difference."

Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving mesalamine; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-\u00adcontaining stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppository is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration (2 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppository therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman\u2019s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician\u2019s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. (5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction: Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. (5.6) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.7) Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. (5.8) Interference With Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4 Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single Dose Administration of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for Tmax and Tlag. of Mesalamine Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 1.2 g (N=47) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g (N=48) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng.h/mL) 9039 N=43 (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng.h/mL) 9578 N=27 (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 N=36 (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max Median (min, max) (h) 9 N=46 (4 to 32.1) 12 (4 to 34.1) 12 (4 to 34) T lag (h) 2 (0 to 8) 2 (1 to 4) 2 (1 to 4) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 (6.38) 7.05 N=33 (5.54) 7.25 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g with a high fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (> 75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ), to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2022hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2022hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means. Table 4 Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Mesalamine Following Single Dose Administration of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic mean of parameter values are presented except for Tmax and Tlag. of Mesalamine Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 1.2 g (N=47) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g (N=48) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g (N=48) AUC 0-t (ng.h/mL) 9039 N=43 (5054) 20538 (12980) 41434 (26640) AUC 0-\u221e (ng.h/mL) 9578 N=27 (5214) 21084 (13185) 44775 N=36 (30302) C max (ng/mL) 857 (638) 1595 (1484) 2154 (1140) T max Median (min, max) (h) 9 N=46 (4 to 32.1) 12 (4 to 34.1) 12 (4 to 34) T lag (h) 2 (0 to 8) 2 (1 to 4) 2 (1 to 4) T 1/2 (h) (Terminal Phase) 8.56 (6.38) 7.05 N=33 (5.54) 7.25 (8.32) Food Effects Administration of a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g with a high fat meal resulted in further delay in absorption, and plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable 4 hours following dosing. However, a high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91 %; mean AUC: increased 16 %) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (> 75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ), to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u2022hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u2022hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2400 mg/kg in mice and 1150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u2264 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6 Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%) . 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria : Contains phenylalanine. Before prescribing APRISO to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including APRISO. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as APRISO that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of APRISO therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using APRISO in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue APRISO if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with APRISO. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to APRISO or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue APRISO if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using APRISO in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue APRISO at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with APRISO. 5.8 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). APRISO contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each APRISO 0.375 g capsule contains 0.56 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing APRISO to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including APRISO. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of APRISO may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to APRISO in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. APRISO was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with APRISO) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of APRISO 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open\u2011label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of APRISO-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 3% of APRISO-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis APRISO 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with APRISO for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder : alopecia Gastrointestinal : lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities : increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders : fatigue Hepatic : hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders : creatinine clearance decreased, hematuria Musculoskeletal : pain, arthralgia Respiratory : dyspnea 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of APRISO or other mesalamine-containing products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less ( see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of APRISO to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for APRISO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from APRISO or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of APRISO in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of APRISO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as APRISO. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with APRISO. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing APRISO [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on APRISO therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue APRISO if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. APRISO is a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g APRISO in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received APRISO 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of APRISO, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of APRISO. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g APRISO and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2.

Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in APRISO capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N\u2011Ac\u20115-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N\u2011Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of APRISO, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g APRISO in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received APRISO 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of APRISO, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of APRISO. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g APRISO and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2.

These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity.

Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either APRISO 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for APRISO than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u22651 and mucosal appearance score \u22652, or premature withdrawal from study.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving mesalamine suppositories; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppository and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppository or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppository if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppository is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppository therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] ."

Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Renal impairment, including renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Severe cutaneous adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions in: \u2022 adults (\u22652%) are headache, flatulence, liver function test abnormal, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 pediatric patients (\u22655%) are abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Induction The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of mesalamine-or placebo-treated adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions* in Two Eight-Week, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Induction Therapy (Study 1 and Study 2) in Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adverse Reaction Mesalamine 2.4 g once daily (n=177) Mesalamine 4.8 g once daily (n=179) Placebo (n=179) Headache 6% 3% <1% Flatulence 4% 3% 3% Liver Function Test Abnormal <1% 2% 1% Alopecia 0 1% 0 Pruritus <1% 1% 1% *Reported in at least 1% of patients in at least one mesalamine group and greater than placebo Pancreatitis occurred in less than 1% of patients during induction in clinical trials and resulted in discontinuation of therapy with mesalamine in patients experiencing this event. Maintenance of Remission A mesalamine dosage of 2.4 g/day, administered as either 1.2 g twice daily or 2.4 g once daily, was evaluated for safety in three maintenance trials in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a 6-month double-blind, active-controlled study (Study 3) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and two 12- to 14-month open-label studies. The most common adverse reactions with mesalamine in these maintenance trials are listed in Table 3.

The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of adults. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of pediatric patients treated with mesalamine were: abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine or other mesalamine-containing products.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2400 mg/kg in mice and 1150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates.(5.1, 7.2, 8.6) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. (5.7) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary Normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Discontinue mesalamine at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions* in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% * Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder : alopecia Gastrointestinal : lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities : increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders : fatigue Hepatic : hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders : creatinine clearance decreased, hematuria Musculoskeletal : pain, arthralgia Respiratory : dyspnea 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mesalamine or other mesalamine-containing products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole : lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiovascular : pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic : jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic : agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Nervous System : intracranial hypertension Neurological/Psychiatric : peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis Renal and Urinary : nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change disease, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7)] \u2022 Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 11\u00b15 14\u00b15 2.1\u00b11.1 4 (2, 16) 9\u00b17 17\u00b16 - 2.7\u00b11.1 4 (2, 8) 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t \u00bd (h) b 26\u00b16 51\u00b123 2.8\u00b10.8 4 (4, 12) 12\u00b111 37\u00b19 - 3.4\u00b10.9 5 (2, 8) 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, Tmax for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect Cmax for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free* Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Maintenance Studies Mesalamine 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.) P-value Study 1 68% (143/209) 51% (49/96) 17% (5.5, 29.2) <0.001 Study 2 71% (117/164) 59% (55/93) 12% (0, 24.5) 0.046 *Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u22651 and mucosal appearance score \u22652, or premature withdrawal from study. Examination of gender subgroups did not identify difference in response to mesalamine among these subgroups. There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations. The use of mesalamine for treating ulcerative colitis beyond six months has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials."

( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine : Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

If concomitant use of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference With Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] ."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data ). There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on Mesalamine Rectal Suppository therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue Mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician\u2019s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the Mesalamine Rectal Suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of Mesalamine Rectal Suppository is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue CANASA if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine- Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving CANASA; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as CANASA that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of CANASA and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using CANASA in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue CANASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with CANASA. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to CANASA or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue CANASA if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using CANASA in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue CANASA at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5. 7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with CANASA. 5. 8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of CANASA is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CANASA or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts ( see Data ) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of CANASA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for CANASA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CANASA or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CANASA in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. CANASA was evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of CANASA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as CANASA who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with CANASA. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing CANASA [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on CANASA therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue CANASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman\u2019s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and above."

No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area)."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman\u2019s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of CANASA, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician\u2019s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg CANASA administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the CANASA 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of CANASA is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria : Contains phenylalanine. Before prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including mesalamine extended-release capsules. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.8 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Mesalamine extended-release capsules contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each mesalamine extended-release 0.375 g capsule contains 0.56 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open\u2011label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2.

Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N\u2011Ac\u20115-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N\u2011Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2.

Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity.

Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u22651 and mucosal appearance score \u22652, or premature withdrawal from study.

Urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine extended-release capsules when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine extended-release capsules may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDs, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ] . Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Patients with Phenylketonuria Inform patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) or their caregivers that each mesalamine extended-release capsule contains aspartame equivalent to 0.56 mg of phenylalanine, so that the recommended adult dosing provides an equivalent of 2.24 mg of phenylalanine per day [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 8.5 ) Pediatric use information is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.\u2019s LIALDA (mesalamine) delayed-release tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine delayed-release tablets to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release tablets have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. Pediatric use information is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.\u2019s LIALDA (mesalamine) delayed-release tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets are a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18-35 years); 28 elderly (65-75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine delayed-release tablets (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2,400 mg/kg in mice and 1,150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%).

      "DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Mesalamine Rectal Suspension, USP Enema, a disposable (60 mL) unit, is mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The empirical formula is C 7 H 7 NO 3 , representing a molecular weight of 153.14. The structural formula is: Each rectal suspension enema unit contains 4 grams of mesalamine. In addition to mesalamine the preparation contains the inactive ingredients carbomer 934P, edetate disodium, potassium acetate, potassium metabisulfite, purified water and xanthan gum. Sodium benzoate is added as a preservative. The disposable unit consists of an applicator tip protected by a polyethylene cover and lubricated with USP white petrolatum. The unit has a one-way valve to prevent back flow of the dispensed product."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Each mesalamine rectal suspension enema delivers up to 4 g of mesalamine to the left side of the colon. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Preclinical Toxicology - Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of > 214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred. The human dose of 4 grams represents approximately 80 mg/kg but when mesalamine is given rectally as a suspension, absorption is poor and limited to the distal colon (see Pharmacokinetics ). Overt renal toxicity has not been observed (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS ), but the potential must be considered. Pharmacokinetics - Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 h), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours [U. Klotz, Clin. Pharmacokin. 10:285-302 (1985)]. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either free or metabolized drug during repeated daily administrations. Efficacy - In a placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial of 153 patients with active distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis or proctitis, mesalamine rectal suspension enema reduced the overall disease activity index (DAI) and individual components as follows: EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON SEVERITY OF DISEASE DATA FROM U.S.- CANADA TRIAL COMBINED RESULTS OF EIGHT CENTERS Activity Indices, mean N Baseline Day 22 End Point Change Baseline to End Point * Overall DAI Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 76 7.42 4.05 \u2020 3.37 \u2021 -55.07% \u2021 Placebo 77 7.40 6.03 5.83 -21.58% Stool Frequency Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.58 1.11 \u00a7 1.01 \u2020 -0.57 \u00a7 Placebo 1.92 1.47 1.50 -0.41 Rectal Bleeding Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.82 0.59 \u2021 0.51 \u2021 -1.30 \u2021 Placebo 1.73 1.21 1.11 -0.61 Mucosal Inflammation Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 2.17 1.22 \u2020 0.96 \u2021 -1.21 \u2020 Placebo 2.18 1.74 1.61 -0.56 Physician's Assessment of Disease Severity Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema 1.86 1.13 \u2021 0.88 \u2021 -0.97 \u2021 Placebo 1.87 1.62 1.55 -0.30 Each parameter has a 4-point scale with a numerical rating: 0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics - Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 h), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours [U. Klotz, Clin. Pharmacokin. 10:285-302 (1985)]. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either free or metabolized drug during repeated daily administrations."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is indicated for the treatment of active mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis or proctitis in adults."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to salicylates, aminosalicylates, sulfites or any other component of this medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. Information for Patients Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine rectal suspension enema when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. Drug Interactions Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine rectal suspension enema and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. Information for Patients - See patient instructions enclosed. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility - Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a 2-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet. Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no effects in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange at doses up to 610 mg/kg. No effects on fertility were observed in rats receiving up to 320 mg/kg/day. The oligospermia and infertility in men associated with sulfasalazine has very rarely been reported among patients treated with mesalamine. Pregnancy - Teratologic studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to five and eight times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women for either sulfasalazine or 5-ASA. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, 5-ASA should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether mesalamine or its metabolite(s) are excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use - Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema, especially if used concomitantly with anticoagulants. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema.

While the effect of mesalamine rectal suspension enema may be seen within 3 to 21 days, the usual course of therapy would be from 3 to 6 weeks depending on symptoms and sigmoidoscopic findings. Studies available to date have not assessed if mesalamine rectal suspension enema will modify relapse rates after the 6-week short-term treatment. Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is for rectal use only. Drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment. Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well to make sure the suspension is homogeneous. The patient should remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. Holding the bottle at the neck will not cause any of the medication to be discharged. The position most often used is obtained by lying on the left side (to facilitate migration into the sigmoid colon); with the lower leg extended and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. An alternative is the knee-chest position. The applicator tip should be gently inserted in the rectum pointing toward the umbilicus. A steady squeezing of the bottle will discharge most of the preparation. The preparation should be taken at bedtime with the objective of retaining it all night. Patient instructions are included with every seven units."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Sulfite-related reactions (mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite) and sulfasalazine-associated reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) can occur; evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given mesalamine rectal suspension enema or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.3 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of mesalamine rectal suspension enema, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine rectal suspension enema to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine rectal suspension enema and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine rectal suspension enema or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Mesalamine Rectal Suspension, USP Enema, a disposable (60 mL) unit, is mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The empirical formula is C 7 H 7 NO 3 , representing a molecular weight of 153.14. The structural formula is: Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is supplied as a suspension for rectal administration. Each rectal suspension enema unit contains 4 grams of mesalamine. The inactive ingredients are carbomer 974P, edetate disodium, potassium acetate, potassium metabisulfite, purified water and xanthan gum. Sodium benzoate is added as a preservative. The disposable unit consists of an applicator tip protected by a polyethylene cover and lubricated with USP white petrolatum. The unit has a one-way valve to prevent back flow of the dispensed product. Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine admixed with diet, mesalamine did not cause an increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls. Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

Important information you need to know before using mesalamine rectal suspension enema \u2022 Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is for rectal use only. \u2022 Do not share mesalamine rectal suspension enema with other people, it may harm them. \u2022 If a caregiver is giving mesalamine rectal suspension enema make sure they read and understand these Instructions for Use. \u2022 Use mesalamine rectal suspension enema exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. \u2022 It is recommended to use 1 mesalamine rectal suspension enema bottle each day. \u2022 After the foil wrapped unit of 7 bottles is opened, use each bottle of mesalamine rectal suspension enema right away. \u2022 Empty bowels right before the medicine is given. \u2022 Give at bedtime. \u2022 Mesalamine rectal suspension enema will stain some surfaces including but not limited to fabrics, flooring, painted surfaces, marble, granite, vinyl, and enamel. Take care in choosing the right place for giving the mesalamine rectal suspension enema. Preparing to use mesalamine rectal suspension enema Step 1. Remove the bottles. \u2022 Remove all the bottles from the protective foil pouch by grasping at the seam and tearing downward or by using scissors at the top of the foil pouch (See Figure A). \u2022 Be careful not to squeeze or puncture bottles. Step 2. Prepare to give the medicine. \u2022 Shake the first bottle well to make sure that the medicine is mixed well. \u2022 Remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. Hold the bottle at the neck so as not to cause any of the medicine to be released (See Figure B). Step 3. Get in position. \u2022 Lay on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed forward for balance (See Figure C). \u2022 Get in the knee-chest position as shown here (See Figure D). Step 4. Giving the medicine. \u2022 Lubricate the applicator tip. \u2022 Gently insert the lubricated applicator tip into the rectum pointing slightly toward the belly button (navel) to prevent damage to the rectal wall. \u2022 Grasp the bottle firmly, then tilt slightly so that the nozzle is aimed toward the back. \u2022 Squeeze the bottle slowly to release the medicine into the rectum (See Figure E). \u2022 Steady hand pressure will release most of the medicine. \u2022 After giving the medicine, withdraw the applicator tip. \u2022 Remain in position for at least 30 minutes to allow the medicine to spread inside the body. \u2022 Throw away (discard) the bottle. \u2022 Try to keep the medicine inside your body all night, if possible.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates. (5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected (5.2) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected (5.3) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment (5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with preexisting skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. (5.7) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of mesalamine-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when mesalamine delayed-release tablets are discontinued. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious or clinically significant adverse reactions described elsewhere in labeling are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and worsening of ulcerative colitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesalamine has been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing mesalamine 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine-delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 400 mg. The most common reactions reported in the mesalamine group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg and 618 patients dosed with the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy: Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [see Data]. There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data Human Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the Nacetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 800 mg. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy: Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Each mesalamine delayed-release tablet for oral administration contains 800 mg of mesalamine USP, an aminosalicylate. Mesalamine, USP is light tan to pink colored, needle-shaped crystals. Color may darken on exposure to air. It is odorless or may have a slight characteristic odor, slightly soluble in water; very slightly soluble in methanol, in dehydrated alcohol, and in acetone; practically insoluble in n -butyl alcohol, in chloroform, in ether, in ethyl acetate, in n -hexane, in methylene chloride, and in n -propyl alcohol and soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and in dilute alkali hydroxides. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 800 mg have single layered coating consisting of an acrylic based resin Eudragit S (methacrylic acid copolymer B, NF), which dissolves at pH 7 or greater, releasing mesalamine for topical anti-inflammatory action in the colon. Mesalamine (also referred to as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA) has the chemical name 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and its structural formula is: Each mesalamine delayed-release tablet contains 800 mg of mesalamine. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: acetyltributyl citrate, colloidal silicone dioxide, ferric oxide red, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type B, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, talc and titanium dioxide. The tablet is printed with opacode black S-1-17823 which contains following ingredients: ammonium hydroxide, butyl alcohol, ferrosoferric oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and shellac.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg was approximately 24 hours [4 to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release tablets is systemically absorbed. Food Effect: A high calorie (800 to 1000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C max by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC 8-48 and AUC 0-tldc ) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t max by 6 hours (from 24 to 30 hours) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Comparative exposure between one mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac-5-ASA. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces."

These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day mesalamine delayed-release tablets dose (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person). Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 4.8 grams per day was studied in a six-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 772 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release tablets three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day). Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%). The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the mesalamine group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]). A second controlled study supported the efficacy of mesalamine at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Inform patients that if they are switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release tablets to discontinue their previous oral mesalamine therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release tablets. One mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg is not substitutable for two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products. Inform patients to take mesalamine delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal. Instruct patients to swallow the mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole, taking care not to break, cut, or chew the tablets, because the coating is an important part of the delayed-release formulation. Drink an adequate amount of fluids. Inform patients that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Instruct patients to protect mesalamine delayed-release tablets from moisture. Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine delayed-release tablets may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDS and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ]. Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088."

( 5.7 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given sfROWASA or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using sfROWASA in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on sfROWASA therapy. Discontinue sfROWASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with sfROWASA. 5.3 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using sfROWASA in patients with known liver impairment. 5.4 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Discontinue sfROWASA at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.5 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.6 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid (N\u2011Ac\u20115\u2011ASA).

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of sfROWASA, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of sfROWASA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sfROWASA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from sfROWASA or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non\u2011detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N\u2011acetyl\u20115-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sfROWASA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as sfROWASA who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with sfROWASA. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing sfROWASA. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on sfROWASA therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue sfROWASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as sfROWASA is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning to treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions , including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with preexisting skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of mesalamine-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when mesalamine delayed-release tablets are discontinued. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and worsening of ulcerative colitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious or clinically significant adverse described elsewhere in labeling are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesalamine has been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing mesalamine 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine-delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 400 mg. The most common reactions reported in the mesalamine group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg and 618 patients dosed with the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 800 mg group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system.

No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [ see Data ]. There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data Human Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the Nacetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 800 mg. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg was approximately 24 hours [4 to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release tablets is systemically absorbed. Food Effect: A high calorie (800 to 1000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C max by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC 8-48 and AUC 0-tldc ) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t max by 6 hours (from 24 to 30 hours) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Comparative exposure between one mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac- 5-ASA. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2000 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day mesalamine delayed-release tablets dose (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person). Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 4.8 grams per day was studied in a six-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 772 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release tablets three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day). Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%). The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the mesalamine group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]). A second controlled study supported the efficacy of mesalamine at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] Inform patients that if they are switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release tablets to discontinue their previous oral mesalamine therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release tablets. One mesalamine delayed-release tablet 800 mg is not substitutable for two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products. Inform patients to take mesalamine delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal. Instruct patients to swallow the mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole, taking care not to break, cut, or chew the tablets, because the coating is an important part of the delayed-release formulation. Drink an adequate amount of fluids. Inform patients that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Instruct patients to protect mesalamine delayed-release tablets from moisture. Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine delayed-release tablets may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDS and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )]. Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Sulfite-related reactions (mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite) and sulfasalazine-associated reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) can occur; evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given mesalamine rectal suspension enema or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.3 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of mesalamine rectal suspension enema, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine rectal suspension enema to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine rectal suspension enema and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine rectal suspension enema or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine admixed with diet, mesalamine did not cause an increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls. Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function (5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) \u2022 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine : Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving MESALAMINE SUPPOSITORIES; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.5 , 7.3 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppositories therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions seen in mesalamine suppositories clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are: \u2022 Renal Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hepatic Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) are: dizziness, rectal pain, fever, rash, acne and colitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are summarized in the Table 1 below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring In More Than 1% of Mesalamine Suppository Treated Patients (Comparison to Placebo) Symptom Mesalamine (n = 177) Placebo (n = 84) N % N % Dizziness 5 3 2 2.4 Rectal Pain 3 1.8 0 0 Fever 2 1.2 0 0 Rash 2 1.2 0 0 Acne 2 1.2 0 0 Colitis 2 1.2 0 0 In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients comparing the mesalamine 1000 mg suppository administered nightly to that of the mesalamine 500 mg suppository twice daily. The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving mesalamine suppositories, the adverse reactions listed below have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories and other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Body as a Whole: drug fever, fatigue, lupus-like syndrome, medication residue \u2022 Cardiac Disorders : myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \u2022 Eye disorders: eye swelling \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, anal pruritus, anorectal discomfort, constipation, feces discolored, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucus stools, nausea, painful defecation, pancreatitis, proctalgia, rectal discharge, rectal tenesmus, stomach discomfort, vomiting \u2022 Hepatic Disorders : cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, jaundice, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes, liver necrosis, liver failure \u2022 Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia \u2022 Neurological/Psychiatric Disorders : Guillain-Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension \u2022 Renal Disorders: interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change nephropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonitis) \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder : alopecia, erythema, erythema nodosum, pruritus, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, urticaria \u2022 Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

( 7.1 ) \u2022 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine : Increased risk of blood disorders; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 7.2) 7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may increase the risk for blood disorders. If concomitant use of mesalamine suppositories and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [see Data] . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5- aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in pediatric patients ages 5 to 17 years is approved for Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s CANASA (mesalamine) rectal suppositories. However, due to Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppositories therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Although the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease is uncertain, both prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators of mucosal injury and inflammation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 6.1 ) pediatric patients (\u22655%) are abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Induction The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of mesalamine- or placebo-treated adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions* in Two Eight-Week, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Induction Therapy (Study 1 and Study 2) in Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adverse Reaction Mesalamine 2.4 g once daily (n=177) Mesalamine 4.8 g once daily (n=179) Placebo (n=179) Headache 6% 3% <1% Flatulence 4% 3% 3% Liver Function Test Abnormal <1% 2% 1% Alopecia 0 1% 0 Pruritus <1% 1% 1% *Reported in at least 1% of patients in at least one mesalamine group and greater than placebo Pancreatitis occurred in less than 1% of patients during induction in clinical trials and resulted in discontinuation of therapy with mesalamine in patients experiencing this event. Maintenance of Remission A mesalamine dosage of 2.4 g/day, administered as either 1.2 g twice daily or 2.4 g once daily, was evaluated for safety in three maintenance trials in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a 6-month double-blind, active-controlled study (Study 3) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and two 12- to 14-month open-label studies. The most common adverse reactions with mesalamine in these maintenance trials are listed in Table 3.

The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of adults. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of pediatric patients treated with mesalamine were: abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiac Disorders: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Gastrointestinal: cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic: jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, hepatotoxicity, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myalgia, lupus-like syndrome Neurological/Psychiatric: peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension Renal Disorders: renal failure, interstitial nephritis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.8 )] Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis), pleurisy/pleuritis Skin: psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, photosensitivity, SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 mg/L to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 mg/kg/day to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4\u00adfold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4\u00adfold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, mesalamine at doses up to 2,500 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2,400 mg/kg in mice and 1,150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral daily doses of 250 mg/kg or higher produced nephrosis, papillary edema, and interstitial fibrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.7 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Interference With Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 6.1 ) pediatric patients (\u22655%) are abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Induction The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of mesalamine- or placebo-treated adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] are listed in Table 2.

The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of adults. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of pediatric patients treated with mesalamine were: abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, headache, and viral infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiac Disorders: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Gastrointestinal: cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic: jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, hepatotoxicity, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myalgia, lupus-like syndrome Neurological/Psychiatric: peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension Renal Disorders: renal failure, interstitial nephritis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.8 )] Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis), pleurisy/pleuritis Skin: psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, photosensitivity, SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 mg/L to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 mg/kg/day to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4\u00adfold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4\u00adfold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (>75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u00b7hr/mL, n=48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500 mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500 mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u22641, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n=262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n=255) n/N (%) Mesalamine 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT02093663) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 , 13.2 ) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment; discontinue treatment, if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules, if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Capsules: Consider the iron content of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients taking iron supplementation and those at risk of iron overload. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release capsules and periodically while on therapy. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risk and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Capsules Mesalamine delayed-release capsules contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release capsules. Each 400 mg delayed-release capsule contains 0.589 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 3.54 mg at the maximum recommended daily dosage in adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Before prescribing mesalamine delayed-release capsules to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk of developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including mesalamine delayed-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions seen in mesalamine clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) are: Adults: eructation, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, rhinitis, back pain, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Pediatrics: nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, sinusitis, rash, cough and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of mesalamine has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In total, mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets have been evaluated in 2690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials. Below is a description of the adverse reactions of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Clinical studies supporting mesalamine delayed-release tablets use for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Studies 1 and 2), and one 6-week, randomized, double-blind, study of 2 dosage levels in children with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Study 3). Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis included a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study (Study 4) and four active-controlled maintenance trials comparing mesalamine delayed-release with sulfasalazine. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets have been evaluated in 427 adults and 107 children with ulcerative colitis in these controlled studies. Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 of whom were randomized to mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], 4% of the mesalamine delayed release tablets-treated patients in 2.4 grams per day group discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions as compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of patients was 41 years and 49% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from mesalamine delayed-release tablets included (each in one patient): diarrhea and colitis flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below. Table 2. Most Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Study 1 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Adults At Least 2% of Patients in the Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Group and at a Rate Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Mesalamine Delayed-Release 2.4 grams per day Placebo (n = 53) (n = 52) Eructation 26 19 Abdominal pain 21 12 Constipation 11 0 Dizziness 9 8 Rhinitis 8 6 Back pain 6 4 Rash 6 4 Dyspepsia 4 0 Flu syndrome 4 2 Pediatric Patients 5 to 17 Years Old A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of 2 dosage levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were divided by body weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective body weight category) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not found to be more effective than the recommended low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Duration of exposure to mesalamine among the 82 patients in the study ranged from 12 to 50 days (mean of 40 days in each dosage group). The majority (88%) of patients in each group were treated for more than 5 weeks. Table 3 provides a summary of the specific reported adverse reactions. Table 3. Adverse Reactions \u2265 5% Reported in Study 3 for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis in Pediatric Patients At Least 5% of Patients in the low dosage or high dosage group Adverse Reaction % of Patients with Adverse Reactions Low Dosage High Dosage (n=41) (n=41) Nasopharyngitis 15 12 Headache 10 5 Abdominal pain 10 2 Dizziness 7 2 Sinusitis 7 0 Rash 5 5 Cough 5 0 Diarrhea 5 0 Fatigue 2 10 Pyrexia 0 7 Increased Lipase 0 5 Low Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 1.2 to 2.4 grams/day; High Dosage = mesalamine 400 mg delayed-release tablet 2.0 to 4.8 grams/day. Dosage was dependent on body weight. Adverse Reactions reported at the 1-week telephone follow-up visit are included. Twelve percent of the patients in the low dosage group (5 patients) and 2% of the patients in the high dosage group (1 patient) had serious adverse reactions. The serious adverse reactions consisted of sinusitis, adenovirus infection, and pancreatitis in one patient each in the low dosage group. Abdominal pain and decreased body mass index occurred in one patient and bloody diarrhea and sclerosing cholangitis also occurred in one patient in the low dosage group. Anemia and syncope occurred in one patient in the high dosage group. Five patients were withdrawn from the study due to adverse reactions: 3 (7%) in the low dosage group (1 patient each with adenovirus infection, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis) and 2 patients (5%) in the high dosage group (1 patient with increased amylase and increased lipase, and 1 patient with upper abdominal pain). In general, the nature and severity of reactions in the pediatric population was similar to those reported in adult populations of patients with ulcerative colitis. Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Clinical studies supporting the use of mesalamine delayed release tablets in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults included a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In Study 4, a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration, 87 patients were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed release tablets 1.6 grams per /day compared to 87 patients randomized to placebo. The average age of patients in Study 4 was 42 years and 55% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal in patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets included (each in one patient): anxiety, stomatitis and asthenia. In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 2, the following occurred at a frequency of 2% or greater in patients who received mesalamine delayed-release tablets in Study 4: abdominal enlargement, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infection, joint disorder, nervousness, paresthesia, hemorrhoids, tenesmus, urinary frequency and vision abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Neck pain, facial edema, edema, lupus-like syndrome, drug fever. Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, pancreatitis, gastritis, increased appetite, cholecystitis, dry mouth, oral ulcers, perforated peptic ulcer, bloody diarrhea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine use in pregnant women. Limited published human data on mesalamine show no increase in the overall rate of congenital malformations. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight; however, these adverse pregnancy outcomes are also associated with active inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, all pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. No evidence of fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose. Mesalamine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Human Data Mesalamine crosses the placenta. In prospective and retrospective studies of over 600 women exposed to mesalamine during pregnancy, the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the background rate in the general population. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight, but it is unclear whether this was due to underlying maternal disease, drug exposure, or both, as active inflammatory bowel disease is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Animal data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 1.9 times (rat) and 3.9 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 mg/L to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 mg/kg/day to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when mesalamine delayed-release capsules are administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing experience suggest a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) in subjects receiving mesalamine delayed-release tablets who are 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine delayed-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Approximately 28% of mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release formulation is absorbed after oral ingestion. Following replicate single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules containing four 100 mg tablets in healthy subjects (N = 146) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48 and AUC tldc values were 150 \u00b1 235 ng/mL, 640 \u00b1 521 ng.h/mL, and 909 \u00b1 777 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules containing four 100 mg tablets was approximately 10 hours [5.5 to 48 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. A high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (geometric mean C max : \u2191 32%; AUC 8-48 h: \u2191 46%; AUC: \u2191 29%) and delayed the median t max by approximately 4 hours compared to results in the fasted state. The observed differences in mesalamine exposure due to concomitant food intake are not considered to be clinically relevant at the total daily dosage of 2.4 grams per day. Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is rapidly acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces. After intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is reported to be approximately 40 minutes. After oral dosing, the median terminal t 1/2 values for mesalamine are usually about 25 hours, but are variable, ranging from 1.5 to 296 hours. There is a large inter-subject and intra-subject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and in their terminal half-lives following administration of mesalamine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study evaluating 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg per day doses of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets administered twice daily for four weeks, the mean C avg values of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients ranged from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL based on data from all dose levels. In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level (that is, 1.2, 2 or 2.4 grams/day based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively)."

In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level (that is, 1.2, 2 or 2.4 grams/day based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively)."

Mutagenesis Mesalamine was negative in the Ames assay for mutagenesis, negative for induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro , and negative for induction of micronuclei (MN) in mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 1.9 times the recommended human treatment dose on a body surface area basis), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 2.4 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person.) Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg (approximately 3 to 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.7 and 1.5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4000 mg/kg/day mesalamine (approximately 8 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6000 mg (approximately 8 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of mesalamine has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults. 14.1 Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Adults Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n=53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n=53), compared to placebo (n=52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient\u2019s functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets showed an improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048). In addition, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day group showed improvement in rectal bleeding and stool frequency. The 1.6 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because it did not produce consistent evidence of effectiveness [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . In a second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks\u2019 duration in 87 patients (Study 2), patients received mesalamine delayed release tablets of 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n=11) and 4.8 grams per day (1.2 grams four times a day; n=38), compared to placebo four times a day (n=38). Mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day for 6 weeks resulted in sigmoidoscopic improvement in 28 of 38 (74%) patients compared to 10 of 38 (26%) placebo patients (p less than 0.001). Also, more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 4.8 grams per day group than the placebo group showed improvement in overall symptoms. The 4.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended because greater efficacy was not demonstrated with this dosage compared to the 2.4 grams per day dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Pediatrics The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed release in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age for treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis are supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed release in adults and a single study in pediatric patients. A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of two dosage levels of mesalamine delayed release tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly or moderately active ulcerative colitis defined as a score of 10 to 55 on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) (which includes assessment of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, number of stools per 24 hours, presence of nocturnal bowel movement and activity level, and has a total maximum score of 85; each of the subscales are scored from 0 to 10 except rectal bleeding which is scored from 0 to 30, and number of stools per 24 hours which is scored from 0 to 15) and rectal bleeding and stool frequency Mayo subscale scores of \u22651 (each of these subscales are scored from zero (normal) to three (most severe). All patients were divided by weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective weight category) or a high dosage (2, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day). Doses were administered every 12 hours. The proportion of patients who achieved success based on the Truncated Mayo Score (TM-Mayo) (based on the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores of the Mayo Score) and based on the PUCAI was measured after 6 weeks of treatment. Success based on TM-Mayo was defined as either partial response (improvement from baseline in stool frequency or rectal bleeding subscores with no worsening in the other) or complete response (both stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores equal 0). Success based on PUCAI was defined as either partial response (PUCAI reduction of greater than or equal to 20 points from Baseline to Week 6 with Week 6 score greater than or equal to 10) or complete response (PUCAI less than 10 at Week 6). There were 41 patients in the low dosage group and 41 patients in the high dosage group who received at least one dose of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets; 36 patients in each dosage group completed the study. Patients were considered treatment failures if they did not achieve success or dropped out due to adverse reaction or lack of efficacy. At Week 6, 73% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 70% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the TM-Mayo; 34% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. At Week 6, 56% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 55% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the PUCAI; 46% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not more effective than the low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 14.2 Maintenance of Remission of Ulcerative Colitis Adults In a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months\u2019 duration in 264 patients (Study 4), patients received mesalamine delayed-release tablets of 0.8 grams per day (400 mg twice a day; n = 90) and 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n = 87), compared to placebo four times a day (n = 87). The proportion of patients treated with 0.8 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission was not statistically significant compared to placebo; the 0.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . The number of patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.6 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis was 61 of 87 (70%) compared with 42 of 87 (48%) of placebo patients (p = 0.005). A pooled efficacy analysis of 4 maintenance trials compared mesalamine delayed release tablets at dosages of 0.8 to 2.8 grams per day, in divided doses ranging from twice daily to four times per day, with sulfasalazine, at dosages of 2 to 4 grams per day. Treatment success was seen in 59 of 98 (59%) patients using mesalamine delayed release tablets and 70 of 102 (69%) patients using sulfasalazine, a non-significant difference."

Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving mesalamine; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppository is 1,000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Body as a Whole: drug fever, fatigue, lupus-like syndrome, medication residue \u2022 Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \u2022 Eye disorders: eye swelling \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, anal pruritus, anorectal discomfort, constipation, feces discolored, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucus stools, nausea, painful defecation, pancreatitis, proctalgia, rectal discharge, rectal tenesmus, stomach discomfort, vomiting \u2022 Hepatic Disorders: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, jaundice, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes, liver necrosis, liver failure \u2022 Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia \u2022 Neurological/Psychiatric Disorders: Guillain-Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension \u2022 Renal Disorders: interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change disease, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.7 )] o Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite containing bleach \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonitis), pleuritis/pleurisy \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder: alopecia, erythema, erythema nodosum, pruritus, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, urticaria, SJS/TEN, DRESS and AGEP [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference With Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts ( see Data ). There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-\u00adaminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppository therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician\u2019s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1,000 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1,000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine 1,000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine is 1,000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

(5.8) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given mesalamine or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on therapy with mesalamine. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Discontinue mesalamine at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 2,100 patients were exposed to mesalamine in clinical trials of ulcerative colitis or another gastrointestinal condition. The most common adverse reactions (i.e., greater than or equal to 1%) were diarrhea (3%), headache (2%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), dyspepsia (2%), vomiting (2%), and rash (1%). The safety of mesalamine was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials (UC-1 and UC-2) of 624 patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis for up to 8 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The most common adverse reaction was nausea and vomiting: 1% in the mesalamine group (N = 451) and 0% in the placebo group (N = 173). Withdrawal from therapy due to adverse reactions was 7% in the mesalamine group and 4% in the placebo group. The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported in less than 1% of patients in UC-1, UC-2, and clinical trials for another gastrointestinal condition. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia Cardiac Disorders: palpitations, pericarditis, vasodilation Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal distention, constipation, duodenal ulcer, dysphagia, eructation, esophageal ulcer, fecal incontinence, GI bleeding, mouth ulcer, pancreatitis, rectal bleeding, stool abnormalities (color or texture change) General disorders and administration site conditions: fever, malaise Infections and infestations: oral moniliasis, conjunctivitis Investigations: GGTP increase, increased alkaline phosphatase, LDH increase, SGOT increase, SGPT increase, lipase increase, amylase increase Metabolism and nutritional disorders: anorexia, edema, thirst Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, leg cramps, myalgia Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, paresthesia Psychiatric disorders: depression, asthenia Renal and urinary disorders: albuminuria, hematuria, urinary frequency Reproductive system and breast disorders: amenorrhea, breast pain, hypomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: pulmonary infiltrates, one week after completion of an 8-week ulcerative colitis study, a 72-year-old male, with no previous history of pulmonary problems, developed dyspnea. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis without eosinophilia by one physician and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonitis by a second physician. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: acne, alopecia, dry skin, eczema, erythema nodosum, nail disorder, photosensitivity, pruritus, sweating, urticaria, ecchymosis, lichen planus 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: chest pain, fatal myocarditis, pericarditis, T-wave abnormalities Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, anemia, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia Hepatic Disorders: cirrhosis, jaundice, including cholestatic jaundice; hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, and possible hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure. Some of these cases were fatal. One case of Kawasaki-like syndrome which included hepatic function changes was also reported. Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, lupus-like syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hypertension Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, interstitial nephritis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, nephrolithiasis, nephrotic syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7)] Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: reversible oligospermia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis), interstitial lung disease, pleurisy/pleuritis, pneumonitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: AGEP, DRESS, SJS/TEN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses of 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) revealed no evidence of adverse developmental effects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to be a topical anti- inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids) and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration 20% to 30% of the mesalamine in mesalamine extended-release capsules is absorbed based on urinary excretion data. Plasma mesalamine concentration peaked at approximately 1 mcg/mL 3 hours following a 1 g mesalamine extended-release capsules dose. Oral mesalamine pharmacokinetics were nonlinear when mesalamine extended-release capsules were dosed from 250 mg to 1 g four times daily, with steady-state mesalamine plasma concentrations increasing about nine times, from 0.14 mcg/mL to 1.21 mcg/mL. The major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, peaked at approximately 3 hours at 1.8 mcg/mL. N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid pharmacokinetics were linear. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The greater than dose proportional increase in PK of mesalamine suggests saturable first pass metabolism. The major metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, is formed due to action of N-acetyltransferase in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Pharmacological activities of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid are unknown, and other metabolites have not been identified. Excretion Following oral administration, plasma mesalamine concentration declined in a biphasic manner after reaching peak concentration. The literature describes a mean terminal half-life of 42 minutes for mesalamine following intravenous administration. Because of the continuous release and absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine extended-release capsules throughout the gastrointestinal tract, the true elimination half-life cannot be determined after oral administration. N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid was the primary compound excreted in the urine (19% to 30%) following mesalamine extended-release capsules dosing. About 130 mg free mesalamine was recovered in the feces following a single 1g mesalamine extended-release capsules dose. Elimination of free mesalamine and salicylates in feces increased proportionately with mesalamine extended-release capsules dose."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine extended-release capsules may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)] . Hepatic Failure Advise patients with known liver disease to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of worsening liver function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n = 367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n = 190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N = 367 Placebo N = 185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: tinnitus, vertigo Dermatological Disorder: alopecia Gastrointestinal: lower abdominal pain, rectal hemorrhage Laboratory Abnormalities: increased triglycerides, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin General Disorders and Administration Site Disorders: fatigue Hepatic: hepatitis cholestatic, transaminases increased Renal Disorders: creatinine clearance decreased, hematuria Musculoskeletal: pain, arthralgia Respiratory: dyspnea 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mesalamine extended-release capsules or other mesalamine-containing products. Because many of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: lupus-like syndrome, drug fever Cardiovascular: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocarditis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer Hepatic: jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, liver necrosis, liver failure, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes Hematologic: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia Nervous System: intracranial hypertension Neurological/Psychiatric: peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis Renal and Urinary: nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change disease, nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.7) ] \u2022 Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. Respiratory/Pulmonary: eosinophilic pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, pleurisy/pleuritis Skin: psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Renal/Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.",
      "Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition."

Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine extended-release capsules are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1 SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n = 24) Multiple Dose after 7 days of treatment (n = 24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11 \u00b1 5 17 \u00b1 6 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14 \u00b1 5 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 T max (h) Median (range); 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); 9 \u00b1 7 10 \u00b1 8 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26 \u00b1 6 37 \u00b1 9 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51 \u00b1 23 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 3.4 \u00b1 0.9 T max (h) 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) 12 \u00b1 11 14 \u00b1 10 In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u2265 1 and mucosal appearance score \u2265 2, or premature withdrawal from study.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Each Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema delivers up to 4 g of mesalamine to the left side of the colon. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Preclinical Toxicology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred. The human dose of 4 grams represents approximately 80 mg/kg but when mesalamine is given rectally as a suspension, absorption is poor and limited to the distal colon (see Pharmacokinetics ). Overt renal toxicity has not been observed (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS ), but the potential must be considered. Pharmacokinetics Mesalamine administered rectally as Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 \u03bcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 h), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours [U. Klotz, Clin. Pharmacokin . 10:285-302 (1985)]. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either free or metabolized drug during repeated daily administrations.

      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema therapy. Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in patients with known liver impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Discontinue Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. Drug Interactions Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema and azathioprine or 6-\u00admercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a 2-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet. Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no effects in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange at doses up to 610 mg/kg. No effects on fertility were observed in rats receiving up to 320 mg/kg/day. The oligospermia and infertility in men associated with sulfasalazine has very rarely been reported among patients treated with mesalamine. Pregnancy Teratologic studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to five and eight times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women for either sulfasalazine or 5-ASA. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, 5-ASA should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether mesalamine or its metabolite(s) are excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema, especially if used concomitantly with anticoagulants. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema.

      "OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine absorption from the colon is limited; however, Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult dosage of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema in 60 mL units is one rectal instillation (4 grams) once a day, preferably at bedtime, and retained for approximately eight hours. While the effect of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema may be seen within 3 to 21 days, the usual course of therapy would be from 3 to 6 weeks depending on symptoms and sigmoidoscopic findings. Studies available to date have not assessed if Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema will modify relapse rates after the 6-week short-term treatment. Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema is for rectal use only. Drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment. Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well to make sure the suspension is homogeneous. The patient should remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. Holding the bottle at the neck will not cause any of the medication to be discharged. The position most often used is obtained by lying on the left side (to facilitate migration into the sigmoid colon); with the lower leg extended and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. An alternative is the knee-chest position. The applicator tip should be gently inserted in the rectum pointing toward the umbilicus. A steady squeezing of the bottle will discharge most of the preparation. The preparation should be taken at bedtime with the objective of retaining it all night. Patient instructions are included with every seven units."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1 Common Adverse Reactions * in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis * Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials.

( 7.3 ) 7.1 Antacids Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in mesalamine extended-release capsules depends on pH, avoid co-administration of mesalamine extended-release capsules with antacids [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 7.2 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.3 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine extended-release capsules and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.4 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 times and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 mg/L to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 mg/kg/day to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 mg/kg/day to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine extended-release capsules are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg * h/mL) 11\u00b15 17\u00b16 AUC 0-inf (mcg * h/mL) 14\u00b15 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.1\u00b11.1 2.7\u00b11.1 T max (h) a 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 9\u00b17 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg * h/mL) 26\u00b16 37\u00b19 AUC 0-inf (mcg * h/mL) 51\u00b123 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.8\u00b10.8 3.4\u00b10.9 T max (h) a 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 12\u00b111 14\u00b110 In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 hours and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 mcg/mL to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 hours to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 hours to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician's rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria : Contains phenylalanine. Before prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including mesalamine extended-release capsules. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.8 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Mesalamine extended-release capsules contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each mesalamine extended-release 0.375 g capsule contains 0.56 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open\u2011label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than with placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with Ulcerative Colitis Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily N=367 Placebo N=185 Headache 11% 8% Diarrhea 8% 7% Upper Abdominal Pain 5% 3% Nausea 4% 3% Nasopharyngitis 4% 3% The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported at a frequency less than 3% in patients treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules for up to 24 months in controlled and open-label trials.

( 7.2 ) Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine: Increased risk of blood disorders; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Antacids Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in mesalamine extended-release capsules depends on pH, avoid co-administration of mesalamine extended-release capsules with antacids [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 7.2 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.3 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine extended-release capsules and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.4 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11\u00b15 17\u00b16 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14\u00b15 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.1\u00b11.1 2.7\u00b11.1 T max (h) a 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 9\u00b17 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26\u00b16 37\u00b19 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51\u00b123 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.8\u00b10.8 3.4\u00b10.9 T max (h) a 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 12\u00b111 14\u00b110 In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N\u2011Ac\u20115-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N\u2011Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u22651 and mucosal appearance score \u22652, or premature withdrawal from study.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration Instruct patients: Swallow the capsules whole. Do not cut, break, crush or chew the capsules. Avoid co-administration of mesalamine extended-release capsules with antacids. Drink an adequate amount of fluids. Mesalamine extended-release capsules can be taken without regard to meals [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine extended-release capsules when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to observe their urine flow. Report to the healthcare provider only if urine is discolored on leaving the body, before contact with any surface or water (e.g., in the toilet). Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine extended-release capsules may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDs, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ] . Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine extended-release capsules and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Patients with Phenylketonuria Inform patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) or their caregivers that each mesalamine extended-release capsule contains aspartame equivalent to 0.56 mg of phenylalanine, so that the recommended adult dosing provides an equivalent of 2.24 mg of phenylalanine per day [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Sulfite-related reactions (mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite) and sulfasalazine-associated reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) can occur; evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests: Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given mesalamine rectal suspension enema or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.3 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of mesalamine rectal suspension enema, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine rectal suspension enema to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine rectal suspension enema and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine rectal suspension enema or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine admixed with diet, mesalamine did not cause an increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls. Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Sulfite-related reactions (mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite) and sulfasalazine -associated reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) can occur; evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5) Photosensitivity: Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine -containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions Mesalamine rectal suspension enema contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine rectal suspension enema or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine - induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given mesalamine rectal suspension enema or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.3 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine rectal suspension enema in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) ,and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine - containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine rectal suspension enema and azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine rectal suspension enema may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of mesalamine rectal suspension enema, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine rectal suspension enema to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine rectal suspension enema and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine rectal suspension enema or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl- 5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine rectal suspension enema did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i. e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine rectal suspension enema who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with mesalamine rectal suspension enema. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing mesalamine rectal suspension enema. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine rectal suspension enema therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine rectal suspension enema if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine rectal suspension enema is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as mesalamine rectal suspension enema is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N- acetyl-5- ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12- month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above. The oral preclinical studies were done with a highly bioavailable suspension where absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract occurred."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1, 7.2, 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u22653%) are: headache, diarrhea, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and nasopharyngitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules were studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Single Dose Multiple Dose c Mesalamine (5-ASA) (n=24) (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11\u00b15 17\u00b16 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14\u00b15 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.1\u00b11.1 2.7\u00b11.1 T max (h) a 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 9\u00b17 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26\u00b16 37\u00b19 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51\u00b123 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.8\u00b10.8 3.4\u00b10.9 T max (h) a 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 12\u00b111 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Single Dose Multiple Dose c Mesalamine (5-ASA) (n=24) (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11\u00b15 17\u00b16 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14\u00b15 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.1\u00b11.1 2.7\u00b11.1 T max (h) a 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 9\u00b17 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26\u00b16 37\u00b19 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51\u00b123 - C max (mcg/mL) 2.8\u00b10.8 3.4\u00b10.9 T max (h) a 4 (4, 12) 5 (2, 8) t \u00bd (h) b 12\u00b111 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity.

Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo.

Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppositories therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions seen in mesalamine suppositories clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are: \u2022 Renal Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hepatic Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) are: dizziness, rectal pain, fever, rash, acne and colitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are summarized in the Table 1 below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring In More Than 1% of Mesalamine Suppository Treated Patients (Comparison to Placebo) Symptom Mesalamine (n = 177) Placebo (n = 84) N % N % Dizziness 5 3 2 2.4 Rectal Pain 3 1.8 0 0 Fever 2 1.2 0 0 Rash 2 1.2 0 0 Acne 2 1.2 0 0 Colitis 2 1.2 0 0 In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients comparing the mesalamine 1000 mg suppository administered nightly to that of the mesalamine 500 mg suppository twice daily. The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving mesalamine suppositories, the adverse reactions listed below have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories and other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Body as a Whole: drug fever, fatigue, lupus-like syndrome, medication residue \u2022 Cardiac Disorders : myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \u2022 Eye disorders: eye swelling \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, anal pruritus, anorectal discomfort, constipation, feces discolored, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucus stools, nausea, painful defecation, pancreatitis, proctalgia, rectal discharge, rectal tenesmus, stomach discomfort, vomiting \u2022 Hepatic Disorders : cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, jaundice, Kawasaki-like syndrome including changes in liver enzymes, liver necrosis, liver failure \u2022 Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia \u2022 Neurological/Psychiatric Disorders : Guillain-Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, intracranial hypertension \u2022 Renal Disorders: interstitial nephritis, renal failure, minimal change nephropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonitis) \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder : alopecia, erythema, erythema nodosum, pruritus, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, urticaria \u2022 Urogenital: reversible oligospermia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [see Data] . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5- aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in pediatric patients ages 5 to 17 years is approved for Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s CANASA (mesalamine) rectal suppositories. However, due to Forest Laboratories, LLC\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppositories therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Although the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease is uncertain, both prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators of mucosal injury and inflammation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra- rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of PENTASA in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue PENTASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Discontinue PENTASA if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using PENTASA in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given PENTASA or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using PENTASA in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on therapy with PENTASA. Discontinue PENTASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with PENTASA. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to PENTASA or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue PENTASA if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using PENTASA in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue PENTASA at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with PENTASA. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine\u2019s main metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

More than 2100 patients were exposed to PENTASA in clinical trials of ulcerative colitis or another gastrointestinal condition. The most common adverse reactions (i.e., greater than or equal to 1%) were diarrhea (3%), headache (2%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), dyspepsia (2%), vomiting (2%), and rash (1%). The safety of PENTASA was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials (UC-1 and UC-2) of 624 patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis for up to 8 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The most common adverse reaction was nausea and vomiting: 1% in the PENTASA group (N=451) and 0% in the placebo group (N=173). Withdrawal from therapy due to adverse reactions was 7% in the PENTASA group and 4% in the placebo group. The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported in less than 1% of patients in UC-1, UC-2, and clinical trials for another gastrointestinal condition. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia Cardiac Disorders: palpitations, pericarditis, vasodilation Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal distention, constipation, duodenal ulcer, dysphagia, eructation, esophageal ulcer, fecal incontinence, GI bleeding, mouth ulcer, pancreatitis, rectal bleeding, stool abnormalities (color or texture change) General disorders and administration site conditions: fever, malaise Infections and infestations: oral moniliasis, conjunctivitis Investigations: GGTP increase, increased alkaline phosphatase, LDH increase, SGOT increase, SGPT increase, lipase increase, amylase increase Metabolism and nutritional disorders: anorexia, edema, thirst Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, leg cramps, myalgia Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, paresthesia Psychiatric disorders: depression, asthenia Renal and urinary disorders: albuminuria, hematuria, urinary frequency Reproductive system and breast disorders: amenorrhea, breast pain, hypomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: pulmonary infiltrates, one week after completion of an 8-week ulcerative colitis study, a 72-year-old male, with no previous history of pulmonary problems, developed dyspnea. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis without eosinophilia by one physician and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonitis by a second physician. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: acne, alopecia, dry skin, eczema, erythema nodosum, nail disorder, photosensitivity, pruritus, sweating, urticaria, ecchymosis, lichen planus 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: chest pain, fatal myocarditis, pericarditis, T-wave abnormalities Hematologic Disorders: agranulocytosis, anemia, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia Hepatic Disorders: cirrhosis, jaundice, including cholestatic jaundice; hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, and possible hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure. Some of these cases were fatal. One case of Kawasaki-like syndrome which included hepatic function changes was also reported. Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, lupus-like syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hypertension Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, interstitial nephritis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, nephrolithiasis, nephrotic syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.7) ] Urine discoloration occurring ex-vivo caused by contact of mesalamine, including inactive metabolite, with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: reversible oligospermia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonitis), interstitial lung disease, pleurisy/pleuritis, pneumonitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: AGEP, DRESS, SJS/TEN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses of 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) revealed no evidence of adverse developmental effects (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PENTASA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for PENTASA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PENTASA or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of PENTASA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as PENTASA who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with PENTASA. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing PENTASA. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on PENTASA therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue PENTASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses of 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) revealed no evidence of adverse developmental effects (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day, based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 g/day based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids) and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration 20% to 30% of the mesalamine in PENTASA is absorbed based on urinary excretion data. Plasma mesalamine concentration peaked at approximately 1 mcg/mL 3 hours following a 1 g PENTASA dose. Oral mesalamine pharmacokinetics were nonlinear when PENTASA capsules were dosed from 250 mg to 1 g four times daily, with steady-state mesalamine plasma concentrations increasing about nine times, from 0.14 mcg/mL to 1.21 mcg/mL. The major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, peaked at approximately 3 hours at 1.8 mcg/mL. N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid pharmacokinetics were linear. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The greater than dose proportional increase in PK of mesalamine suggests saturable first pass metabolism. The major metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, is formed due to action of N-acetyltransferase in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Pharmacological activities of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid are unknown, and other metabolites have not been identified. Excretion Following oral administration, plasma mesalamine concentration declined in a biphasic manner after reaching peak concentration. The literature describes a mean terminal half-life of 42 minutes for mesalamine following intravenous administration. Because of the continuous release and absorption of mesalamine from PENTASA throughout the gastrointestinal tract, the true elimination half-life cannot be determined after oral administration. N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid was the primary compound excreted in the urine (19% to 30%) following PENTASA dosing. About 130 mg free mesalamine was recovered in the feces following a single 1g PENTASA dose. Elimination of free mesalamine and salicylates in feces increased proportionately with PENTASA dose."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3) Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets : Consider the iron content of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients taking iron supplementation and those at risk of iron overload. ( 5.8 ) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of mesalamine delayed-release-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of mesalamine delayed-release tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when mesalamine delayed-release tablets are discontinued. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine delayed-release in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine delayed-release. 5.8 Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Mesalamine delayed-release tablets contains iron oxide as a colorant in the coating of the delayed-release tablets. Each 800 mg delayed-release tablet contains 0.5001 mg of iron. The total content of iron is 3.0006 mg at the recommended daily dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Before prescribing mesalamine delayed-release to patients receiving iron supplementation or those at risk for developing iron overload, consider the combined daily amount of iron from all sources, including mesalamine delayed-release. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine delayed-release may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious or clinically significant adverse described elsewhere in labeling are: Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and worsening of ulcerative colitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesalamine delayed-release has been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing mesalamine delayed-release 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine-delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release (800 mg) tablets and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release (400 mg) tablets. The most common reactions reported in the mesalamine delayed-release group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release and 618 patients dosed with mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system. Table 1.

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose ( see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data Human Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 mg/L to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 mg/kg/day to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine delayed-release did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine\u00adcontaining products such as mesalamine delayed-release. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with mesalamine delayed-release. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine delayed-release [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine delayed-release therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent of further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine delayed-release is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Following single dose oral administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C max , AUC 8-48h and AUC 0-tldc values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] T max for mesalamine following administration of mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet was approximately 24 hours [4 to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation. Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in mesalamine delayed-release tablets is systemically absorbed. Food Effect: A high calorie (800 to 1,000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C max by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC 8-48 and AUC 0-tldc ) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t max by 6 hours (from 24 to 30 hours) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Comparative exposure between one mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Elimination Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac-5\u00adASA. Excretion Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2,000 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day mesalamine delayed-release dose (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person.) Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1,000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia. In mice, oral doses of 4,000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis. In dogs, single doses of 6,000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release at 4.8 grams per day was studied in a six-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 772 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the mesalamine delayed-release 4.8 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release tablets three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day). Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%). The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the mesalamine delayed-release group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]). A second controlled study supported the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine delayed-release."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] Inform patients that if they are switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release tablets to discontinue their previous oral mesalamine therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release tablets. One mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet is not substitutable for two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products. Inform patients to take mesalamine delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal. Instruct patients to swallow the mesalamine delayed-release tablets whole, taking care not to break, cut, or chew the tablets, because the coating is an important part of the delayed-release formulation. Drink an adequate amount of fluids . Inform patients that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Instruct patients to protect mesalamine delayed-release tablets from moisture. Renal Impairment Inform patients that mesalamine delayed-release tablets may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, including NSAIDS, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of Acute Intolerance Syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Hepatic Failure Inform patients with known liver disease of the signs and symptoms of worsening liver function and advise them to report to their healthcare provider if they experience such signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking mesalamine delayed-release tablets and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Iron Content of Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they take iron-containing supplements [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Urine Discoloration Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking Mesalamine Delayed-Release Tablets when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : Sulfite-related reactions (ROWASA contains potassium metabisulfite) and sulfasalazine-associated reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) can occur; evaluate patients immediately and discontinue ROWASA if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of ROWASA in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drug. Discontinue ROWASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache and rash) is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using ROWASA in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other sings of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity : Avoid sun exposure if pre-existing skin conditions. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests : Mesalamine may lead to elevated urinary normetanephrine test results. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sulfite-Related Reactions ROWASA contains potassium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic or in atopic nonasthmatic persons. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or emergency situations even though epinephrine injection contains sodium or potassium metabisulfite with the above-mentioned potential liabilities. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in epinephrine injection should not deter the administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations. Sulfasalazine-Associated Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to ROWASA or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue ROWASA if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure have been reported in patients given ROWASA or other products that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Evaluate the risks and benefits of using ROWASA in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on ROWASA therapy. Discontinue ROWASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.3 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact frequency of occurrence cannot be ascertained, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with ROWASA. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using ROWASA in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Discontinue ROWASA at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre\u2011existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine\u2011containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 5.8 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid (N\u2011Ac\u20115\u2011ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, rats and rabbits administered mesalamine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, did not reveal any evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of ROWASA, during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increase risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed with mesalamine in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 5 and 8 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, and have revealed no evidence of harm to the embryo or the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data ) . There are case reports of diarrhea observed in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of mesalamine on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of ROWASA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ROWASA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ROWASA or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non\u2011detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N\u2011acetyl\u20115-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day of mesalamine (RID 0% to 0.1%) and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N\u2011acetyl\u20115\u2011aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of ROWASA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as ROWASA who were 65 years or older compared to younger adult patients, which may also be associated with ulcerative colitis, use of interacting drugs, or reduced renal function. Consider monitoring complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in patients 65 years and over during treatment with ROWASA. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in patients 65 years and over when prescribing ROWASA. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on ROWASA therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue ROWASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of 5-ASA (mesalamine) is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine administered rectally as ROWASA is poorly absorbed from the colon and is excreted principally in the feces during subsequent bowel movements. The extent of absorption is dependent upon the retention time of the drug product, and there is considerable individual variation. Under clinical conditions patients demonstrated plasma levels 10 to 12 hours post mesalamine administration of 2 mcg/mL, about two-thirds of which was the N-acetyl metabolite. In addition, steady state plasma levels demonstrated a lack of accumulation of either parent drug or N-acetyl metabolite during repeated daily rectal administrations. Distribution Other than the kidney, the organ distribution and other bioavailability characteristics of absorbed mesalamine in man are not known. The poor colonic absorption of rectally administered mesalamine is substantiated by the low serum concentration of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA seen in ulcerative colitis patients after dosage with mesalamine. Elimination Metabolism It is known that the compound undergoes acetylation but whether this process takes place at colonic or systemic sites has not been elucidated. Excretion Whatever the metabolic site, most of the absorbed mesalamine is excreted in the urine as the N-acetyl-5-ASA metabolite. At steady state, approximately 10 to 30% of the daily 4-gram dose can be recovered in cumulative 24-hour urine collections. While the elimination half-life of mesalamine is short (0.5 to 1.5 hours), the acetylated metabolite exhibits a half-life of 5 to 10 hours."

Mutagenesis Mesalamine is not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538. There were no reverse mutations in an assay using E. coli strain WP2UVRA. There were no evidence of genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at 600 mg/kg and in an in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay at doses up to 610 mg/kg. Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine had no effects on fertility in rats at doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.78 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Preclinical studies have shown the kidney to be the major target organ for mesalamine toxicity. Adverse renal function changes were observed in rats after a single 600 mg/kg oral dose, but not after a 200 mg/kg dose. Gross kidney lesions, including papillary necrosis, were observed after a single oral >900 mg/kg dose, and after I.V. doses of >214 mg/kg. Mice responded similarly. In a 13-week oral (gavage) dose study in rats, the high dose of 640 mg/kg/day mesalamine caused deaths, probably due to renal failure, and dose-related renal lesions (papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury) were seen in most rats given the high dose (males and females) as well as in males receiving lower doses 160 mg/kg/day. Renal lesions were not observed in the 160 mg/kg/day female rats. Minimal tubular epithelial damage was seen in the 40 mg/kg/day males and was reversible. In a six-month oral study in dogs, the no-observable dose level of mesalamine was 40 mg/kg/day and doses of 80 mg/kg/day and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration in kidneys was observed at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above admixed with diet for 52 weeks, and at 127 weeks increased incidence of kidney degeneration and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were seen at 100 mg/kg/day and above. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Instructions for Use ). Renal Impairment Inform patients that ROWASA may decrease their renal function, especially if they have known renal impairment or are taking nephrotoxic drugs, and periodic monitoring of renal function will be performed while they are on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Instruct patients to stop taking ROWASA and report to their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening symptoms of acute intolerance syndrome (cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash) or other symptoms suggestive of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ] . Hepatic Failure Advise patients with known liver disease to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of worsening liver function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Instruct patients to stop taking ROWASA and report to their healthcare provider at first appearance of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction or other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Photosensitivity Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Nephrolithiasis Instruct patients to drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation and to contact their healthcare provider if they experience signs or symptoms of a kidney stone (e.g., severe side or back pain, blood in the urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Blood Disorders Inform elderly patients and those taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine of the risk for blood disorders and the need for periodic monitoring of complete blood cell counts and platelet counts while on therapy. Advise patients to complete all blood tests ordered by their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Administration Advise patients that ROWASA will cause staining of direct contact surfaces, including but not limited to fabrics, flooring, painted surfaces, marble, granite, vinyl, and enamel. Administer the product in a suitable location. Instruct patients: \u2022 Shake the bottle to ensure the suspension is homogeneous. \u2022 Remove the protective sheath from the applicator tip. \u2022 Lie on the left side with the lower leg extended and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. Alternatively, alternative is the knee-chest position. \u2022 Gently insert the applicator tip in the rectum pointing toward the umbilicus. \u2022 Steadily squeeze the bottle to discharge the medication. \u2022 Administer at bedtime with the objective of retaining it all night. \u2022 Drink an adequate amount of fluids during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . \u2022 Advise patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking ROWASA when it comes in contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ROWASA [ro wa sa] (mesalamine) rectal suspension This Instructions for Use contains information on how to use ROWASA rectal suspension. Read these Instructions for Use that come with your ROWASA rectal suspension before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. How should I Store ROWASA? \u2022 Store ROWASA at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). \u2022 ROWASA is an off-white to tan colored suspension. The medicine removed from the foil pouch may darken with time. Slight darkening will not affect how well ROWASA works. \u2022 Throw away ROWASA rectal suspensions with dark brown medicine. \u2022 Keep ROWASA and all medicines out of the reach of children. Important Information You Need to Know Before Using ROWASA \u2022 ROWASA is for rectal use only. \u2022 Do not share ROWASA with other people, it may harm them. \u2022 If a caregiver is giving ROWASA make sure they read and understand these Instructions for Use. \u2022 Use ROWASA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. \u2022 It is recommended to use 1 ROWASA bottle each day. \u2022 After the foil wrapped unit of 7 bottles is opened, use each bottle of ROWASA rectal suspension right away. \u2022 Empty bowels right before the medicine is given. \u2022 Give at bedtime. \u2022 ROWASA will stain some surfaces including but not limited to fabrics, flooring, painted surfaces, marble, granite, vinyl, and enamel.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. (5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6) Mesalamine- Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) . Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions , Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors (5.6) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. (5.7) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules -treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsule in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose after 7 days of treatment (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11 \u00b1 5 17 \u00b1 6 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14 \u00b1 5 -- C max (mcg/mL) 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 T max (h) Median (range) 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t 1/2 (h) Harmonic mean (pseudo SD) 9 \u00b1 7 10 \u00b1 8 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26 \u00b1 6 37 \u00b1 9 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51 \u00b1 23 -- C max (mcg/mL) 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 3.4 \u00b1 0.9 T max (h) 2 4 (4,12) 5 (2, 8) t 1/2 (h) 12 \u00b1 11 14 \u00b1 10 In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended- release capsule, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose after 7 days of treatment (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 11 \u00b1 5 17 \u00b1 6 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 14 \u00b1 5 -- C max (mcg/mL) 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 T max (h) Median (range) 4 (2, 16) 4 (2, 8) t 1/2 (h) Harmonic mean (pseudo SD) 9 \u00b1 7 10 \u00b1 8 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) 26 \u00b1 6 37 \u00b1 9 AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) 51 \u00b1 23 -- C max (mcg/mL) 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 3.4 \u00b1 0.9 T max (h) 2 4 (4,12) 5 (2, 8) t 1/2 (h) 12 \u00b1 11 14 \u00b1 10 In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended- release capsule, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free Relapse counted as rectal bleeding score \u2265 1 and mucosal appearance score \u2265 2, or premature withdrawal from study. Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Maintenance Studies Mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.)

There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations. The use of mesalamine extended-release capsules for treating ulcerative colitis beyond six months has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity : Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules-treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine extended-release capsules to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsules in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dosec (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h)a t \u00bd (h)b 11\u00b15 14\u00b15 2.1\u00b11.1 4 (2, 16) 9\u00b17 17\u00b16 - 2.7\u00b11.1 4 (2, 8) 10\u00b18 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h)a t \u00bd (h)b 26\u00b16 51\u00b123 2.8\u00b10.8 4 (4, 12) 12\u00b111 37\u00b19 - 3.4\u00b10.9 5 (2, 8) 14\u00b110 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n=30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32%\u00b111% (mean\u00b1SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine pellets (the same pellets contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine pellets in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43\u00b16% and 78\u00b11% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2.

These doses are about 2.6 and 5.4 times the recommended human dose of granulated mesalamine capsules of 1.5 g/day (30 mg/kg if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1,110 mg/m 2 ), respectively, based on body surface area. Mesalamine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the sister chromatid exchange assay in the Chinese hamster bone marrow test, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats were observed with oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Renal Toxicity Animal studies with mesalamine (13-week and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats, and 26-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in dogs) have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Single oral doses of 800 mg/kg (about 2.2 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) and 1,800 mg/kg (about 9.7 times the recommended human dose, on the basis of body surface area) of mesalamine were lethal to mice and rats, respectively, and resulted in gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day (about 0.20 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) produced minimal to slight tubular injury, and doses of 160 mg/kg/day (about 0.90 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in rats produced renal lesions including tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and papillary necrosis. Oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (about 1.1 times the human dose, on the basis of body surface area) or higher in dogs also produced renal lesions including tubular atrophy, interstitial cell infiltration, chronic nephritis, and papillary necrosis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free* Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Maintenance Studies Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.)

Examination of gender subgroups did not identify difference in response to mesalamine extended-release capsules among these subgroups. There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations.

Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving mesalamine suppositories; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppository and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppositories or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severecutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia andsystemicsymptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use ofmesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and considerfurtherevaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data). There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine suppositories who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppositories therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman\u2019s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician\u2019s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1,000 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1,000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine 1,000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1,000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine- Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.6) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. (5.7) Interference with Laboratory Tests : Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Some patients have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine extended-release capsules or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine extended-release capsules in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine extended-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The data described below reflect exposure to mesalamine extended-release capsules in 557 patients, including 354 exposed for at least 6 months and 250 exposed for greater than one year. Mesalamine extended-release capsules was studied in two placebo-controlled trials (n=367 treated with mesalamine extended-release capsules) and in one open-label, long-term study (n=190 additional patients). The population consisted of patients with ulcerative colitis; the mean age was 47 years, 54% were female, and 93% were white. Patients received doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g administered orally once per day for six months in the placebo-controlled trials and for up to 24 months in the open-label study. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the most common reactions reported in at least 3% of mesalamine extended-release capsules -treated patients and at a greater rate than placebo are shown in Table 1 below.

( 7.3 ) 7.1 Antacids Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in mesalamine extended-release capsules depends on pH, avoid co-administration of mesalamine extended-release capsules with antacids [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 7.2 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.3 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine extended-release capsules and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.4 Interference with Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine extended-release capsules may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk in major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 2% or less (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0 to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mesalamine extended-release capsule in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesalamine extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine extended-release capsules. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine extended-release capsules. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine extended-release capsules therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine extended-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine extended-release capsules are an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function.Mesalamine extended-release capsules are a pH-dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood, but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after a single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g (four 0.375 g capsules)once daily for 7 consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended-release capsules, peak plasma concentrations were observed at about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC 0-24 ) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed when compared with a single-dose of mesalamine extended-release capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine extended-release capsules and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting condition are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Single Dose and Multiple Dose Mean (\u00b1SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Mesalamine (5-ASA) and N-Ac-5-ASA After 1.5 g Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Administration in Healthy Subjects Mesalamine (5-ASA) Single Dose (n=24) Multiple Dose c (n=24) AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t 1/2 (h) b 11 \u00b1 5 14 \u00b1 5 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 4 (2, 16) 9 \u00b1 7 17 \u00b1 6 - 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 4 (2,8) 10 \u00b1 8 N-Ac-5-ASA AUC 0-24 (mcg*h/mL) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) C max (mcg/mL) T max (h) a t 1/2 (h) b 26 \u00b1 6 51 \u00b1 23 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 4 (4,12) 12 \u00b1 11 37 \u00b1 9 - 3.4 \u00b1 0.9 5 (2,8) 14 \u00b1 10 a Median (range); b Harmonic mean (pseudo SD); c after 7 days of treatment In a separate study (n = 30), it was observed that under fasting conditions about 32% \u00b1 11% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the administered dose was systemically absorbed based on the combined cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA over 96 hours post-dose. Food Effects The effect of a high fat meal intake on absorption of mesalamine granules (the same granules contained in mesalamine extended-release capsules) was evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects received 1.6 g of mesalamine granules in sachet (2 x 0.8 g) following an overnight fast or a high fat meal in a crossover study. Under fed conditions, T max for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA was prolonged by 4 and 2 hours, respectively. A high fat meal did not affect C max for 5-ASA, but a 27% increase in the cumulative urinary excretion of 5-ASA was observed with a high fat meal. The overall extent of absorption of N-Ac-5-ASA was not affected by a high fat meal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution In an in vitro study, at 2.5 mcg/mL, mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA are 43 \u00b1 6% and 78 \u00b1 1% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins. Protein binding of N-Ac-5-ASA does not appear to be concentration dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The major metabolite of mesalamine is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). It is formed by N-acetyltransferase activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Excretion Following single and multiple doses of mesalamine extended- release capsule, the mean half-lives were 9 to 10 hours for 5-ASA, and 12 to 14 hours for N-Ac-5-ASA. Of the approximately 32% of the dose absorbed, about 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared with about 30% of the dose excreted as N-Ac-5-ASA. Drug Interaction Studies In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-Ac-5-ASA, were shown not to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Therefore, mesalamine and its metabolite are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%). Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician\u2019s rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12. At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1.0. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. For the table below (Table 3) all patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses. In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine extended-release capsules than for placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Ulcerative Colitis Patients Relapse-Free* Through 6 Months in Mesalamine Extended-Release Capsules Maintenance Studies Mesalamine extended-release capsules 1.5 g once daily % (# no relapse/N) Placebo % (# no relapse/N) Difference (95% C.I.)

Examination of gender subgroups did not identify difference in response to mesalamine extended-release capsules among these subgroups. There were too few elderly and too few African-American patients to adequately assess difference in effects in those populations.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. ( 5.6 ) Nephrolithiasis: Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving mesalamine suppositories; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine suppositories that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine suppository and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine suppository or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine suppository if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine suppositories in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Discontinue mesalamine suppositories at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Photosensitivity In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.7 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. 5.8 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppository is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine suppositories or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients: Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts (see Data) . There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine suppositories to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine suppositories or from the underlying maternal conditions. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Mesalamine suppositories were evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine suppositories. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine suppositories [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine suppository therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C min ) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C max ) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state. Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK +/- ) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test. No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of >214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman's capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of mesalamine suppositories, based on body surface area) and above."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment : Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Evaluate the risks and benefits of mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. (5.1, 7.1, 8.6) \u2022 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Monitor for worsening symptoms while on treatment. Discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (5.2) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including myocarditis and pericarditis : Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue mesalamine if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (5.3) \u2022 Hepatic Failure : Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. (5.4) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. (5.5) \u2022 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction : Avoid in patients with pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction. (5.6) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Advise patients with pre-existing skin conditions to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. (5.7) \u2022 Nephrolithiasis : Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine. Mesalamine-containing stones are undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment. (5.8) \u2022 Interference With Laboratory Tests: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. (5.9) 5.1 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as mesalamine delayed-release tablets that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine therapy and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.4 Hepatic Failure There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Discontinue mesalamine at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation . 5.6 Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. 5.7 Photosensitivity Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors. 5.8 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones with a 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with mesalamine. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Increased risk of blood dyscrasias; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Data Human Data Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products. Animal Data Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data) . There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea. Data In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine has been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine has not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine. Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

Severe intoxication with salicylates may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance, and potentially end organ (e.g., renal and liver) damage. There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage and may include gastrointestinal tract decontamination to prevent further absorption. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function. Mesalamine is a pH-dependent, delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (> 75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n = 3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n = 48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22% of the administered dose. Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g, and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

However, a high-fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean C max : increased 91%; mean AUC: increased 16%) compared to results in the fasted state. Mesalamine delayed-release tablets were administered with food in the controlled clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In a single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy subjects per dose group. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose. Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing. Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics. Distribution Mesalamine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins at the concentration of 2.5 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism The only major metabolite of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Its formation is brought about by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, principally by NAT-1. Excretion Excretion of mesalamine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation); however, there is also limited excretion of the parent drug in urine. Of the approximately 21% to 22% of the dose absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The mean renal clearance (CL R ) in adults ranged from 1.8 L/h to 2.9 L/h following single dose administration and ranged from 5.5 L/h to 6.4 L/h after a multiple dosing for 14 days. The apparent terminal half-lives for mesalamine and its major metabolite after administration of mesalamine 2.4 g and 4.8 g were, on average, 7 to 9 hours and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. Systemic exposures in adult subjects were inversely correlated with renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female subjects (28 young (18 to 35 years); 28 elderly (65 to 75 years); 15 elderly (> 75 years)). Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in C max ) to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Increased age resulted in a slower apparent elimination of mesalamine, though there was high between-subject variability.

Pharmacokinetic parameters had moderate to high inter-subject variability with CV% ranging from 36% to 52% in pediatric patients. The overall systemic exposure of mesalamine following oral administration of 4.8 g once daily for 7 days in a limited number of pediatric patients 5 years to 17 years of age (AUC range of 30,556 to 50,388 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n = 3) was in similar range to that was observed in the healthy adults (AUC of 41,434 \u00b1 26,640 ng\u22c5hr/mL, n = 48) after single dose administration. The mean renal clearance (CLR) of mesalamine in pediatric patients (range from approximately 5.0 to 6.5 L/h) seems to be similar to that observed with healthy adult subjects after multiple dose administration. Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of mesalamine (4.8 g given once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of four commonly used antibiotics were evaluated in healthy subjects. The four antibiotics studied and their dosing regimens were as follows: amoxicillin (single 500-mg dose), ciprofloxacin XR (single 500-mg dose), metronidazole (750 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg twice daily for 3.5 days). The change in C max and AUC of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole when they were co-administered with mesalamine were all 3% or less. There was an increase of 12% in C max and an increase of 15% in AUC of sulfamethoxazole when sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was coadministered with mesalamine. Coadministration of mesalamine did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of any of the four antibiotics."

This dose is 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Furthermore, in a 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats, mesalamine up to a dose of 800 mg/kg/day was not tumorigenic. This dose is 1.4 times the recommended human dose (based on a body surface area comparison) of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an in vitro Ames test or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed in male or female rats at oral doses of mesalamine up to 400 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal studies with mesalamine, a 13-week oral toxicity study in mice and 13-week and 52-week oral toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of mesalamine toxicity. Oral daily doses of 2400 mg/kg in mice and 1150 mg/kg in rats produced renal lesions including granular and hyaline casts, tubular degeneration, tubular dilation, renal infarct, papillary necrosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Induction of Remission Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1, NCT00503243 and Study 2, NCT00548574) were conducted in 517 adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of \u2264 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline. In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6). Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages also provided consistent benefit in secondary efficacy parameters, including clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic improvement. Both mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages had similar efficacy profiles. Table 6: Proportion of Adult Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis in Remission at Week 8 in Two Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Induction Trials Dose Study 1 (n = 262) n/N (%) Study 2 (n = 255) n/N (%) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g/day 30/88 (34) 34/84 (41) Mesalamine delayed-release tablets 4.8 g/day 26/89 (29) 35/85 (41) Placebo 11/85 (13) 19/86 (22) Maintenance of Remission A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (Study 3, NCT00151892) was conducted in a total of 826 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either mesalamine 2.4 g administered once daily or another mesalamine delayed-release product administered as 0.8 g twice daily. The study population had a mean age of 45 years (8% age 65 years or older), were 52% male, and were primarily Caucasian (64%). Maintenance of remission was assessed using a modified UC-DAI. For this trial, maintenance of remission was based on maintaining endoscopic remission defined as a modified UC-DAI endoscopy subscore of \u22641. An endoscopy subscore of 0 represented normal mucosal appearance with intact vascular pattern and no friability or granulation. For this trial the endoscopy score definition of 1 (mild disease) was modified such that it could include erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and minimal granularity; however, it could not include friability. The proportion of patients who maintained remission at Month 6 in this study using mesalamine 2.4 g once daily (84%) was similar to the comparator (82%). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis Weighing at Least 24 kg A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study ( NCT02093663 ) was conducted in pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis to determine the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine. The study consisted of two treatment phases, an initial 8-week phase and a 26-week phase. The overall population consisted of 105 patients, of whom 27 patients participated in both the 8-week and 26-week phases. Each phase included two dosage arms and patients were randomized at the beginning of each phase in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by body weight group. Patients received a low or a high weight-based dosage of mesalamine in four weight groups. Because of the small number of patients in the lowest body weight group (0 in the 8-week phase and 3 in the 26-week phase), the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine in patients weighing less than 24 kg have not been established. Patients were eligible for the initial 8-week phase if they had mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis as defined by the UC-DAI score of at least 4 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. In the 53 patients enrolled in the initial phase, the mean age and weight of patients was 14 years and 53 kg, the mean (SD) baseline UC-DAI score was 5.8 (1.8), 93% were white, and 59% were male. The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8-week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%). Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26-week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26-week phase without having participated in the 8-week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability). There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26-week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8-week phase. In the 26-week phase, the arm with a higher than recommended mesalamine dosage was not more effective and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Other Endpoints Clinical remission, defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore equal to 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore equal to 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability) or 0 on the UC-DAI, was determined for patients with available endoscopic assessment after completion of the 26-week phase. Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission. Clinical remission could not be assessed in the initial 8-week phase because there were too few patients who underwent endoscopy."
