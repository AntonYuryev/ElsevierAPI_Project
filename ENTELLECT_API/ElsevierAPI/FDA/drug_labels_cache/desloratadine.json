      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions. [ See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] \u2022 The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22652% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Virtus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-848-3593 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1655) Placebo (n=1652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were (rates for Desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F 1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the perinatal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F 1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F 1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F 0 dams. F 1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F 2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [ See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) .] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of Desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Desloratadine Tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets or Desloratadine Oral Solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . ] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . ] 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15-35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5-mg dose of Oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25-2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg dose of Desloratadine Oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51-69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34-43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5-29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with Desloratadine Tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with Desloratadine Tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2 ), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15-35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old).

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106-108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106-108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of Desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, Desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering Desloratadine Tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3 . Table 3 TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 2 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline At baseline, a total nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 6 and a total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 5 (each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. (SEM) Change from Baseline Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. (SEM) Placebo Comparison ( P -value) SEM = Standard Error of the Mean Desloratadine 5.0 mg (171) 14.2 (0.3) -4.3 (0.3) P <0.01 Placebo (173) 13.7 (0.3) -2.5 (0.3) There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of Desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4). Table 4 TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 4 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline At baseline, average of total symptom score (sum of 5 individual nasal symptoms and 3 non-nasal symptoms, each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) of at least 10 was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. (SEM) Change from Baseline Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 4 week treatment period. (SEM) Placebo Comparison ( P -value) SEM = Standard Error of the Mean Desloratadine 5.0 mg (337) 12.37 (0.18) -4.06 (0.21) P =0.01 Placebo (337) 12.30 (0.18) -3.27 (0.21) 14.3 Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria The efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of whom 211 received Desloratadine. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, Desloratadine Tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"Number of Hives\" and the \"Size of the Largest Hive,\" when compared to placebo.

Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1.

There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC- based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri- natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.1 ).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0 to 24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions. [ See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] \u2022 The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22652% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Virtus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-848-3593 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1655) Placebo (n=1652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were (rates for Desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F 1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the perinatal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F 1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F 1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F 0 dams. F 1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F 2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [ See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) .] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of Desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Desloratadine Tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets or Desloratadine Oral Solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . ] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . ] 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post-marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the Desloratadine product. In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day somnolence was reported. In another study, no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of Desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15-35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5-mg dose of Oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25-2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg dose of Desloratadine Oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51-69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34-43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5-29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with Desloratadine Tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with Desloratadine Tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2 ), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106-108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of Desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, Desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering Desloratadine Tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3 . Table 3 TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 2 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline At baseline, a total nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 6 and a total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 5 (each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. (SEM) Change from Baseline Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. (SEM) Placebo Comparison ( P -value) SEM = Standard Error of the Mean Desloratadine 5.0 mg (171) 14.2 (0.3) -4.3 (0.3) P <0.01 Placebo (173) 13.7 (0.3) -2.5 (0.3) There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of Desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4). Table 4 TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 4 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline At baseline, average of total symptom score (sum of 5 individual nasal symptoms and 3 non-nasal symptoms, each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) of at least 10 was required for trial eligibility.

(SEM) Placebo Comparison ( P -value) SEM = Standard Error of the Mean Desloratadine 5.0 mg (337) 12.37 (0.18) -4.06 (0.21) P =0.01 Placebo (337) 12.30 (0.18) -3.27 (0.21) 14.3 Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria The efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of whom 211 received Desloratadine. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, Desloratadine Tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"Number of Hives\" and the \"Size of the Largest Hive,\" when compared to placebo.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u2265 2% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2,834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1,655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u2265 2% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n = 1,655) Placebo (n = 1,652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine tablets and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3%, 1.6%), and nausea (3%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATATIONS Renal impairment: dosage adjustment is recommended (2.5, 8.6, 12.3) Hepatic impairment: dosage adjustment is recommended (2.5, 8.7, 12.3) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with desloratadine in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri-and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the perinatal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother\u2019s clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution has not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy . [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .",

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1- receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution: Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism: Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3,748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1,575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination: The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar Tmax and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u2265 65 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg desloratadine tablet. However, the Cmax and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the Cmax and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m2), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean Cmax and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine Cmax and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine Cmax and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in Cmax and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC0-24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility There was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A male specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic testicular changes, occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg in rats (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on fertility in rats at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 8 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose)."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2,300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1,838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks\u2019 duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.

TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. \u2020Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1,300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks\u2019 duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).] The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u2265 2% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-BION or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u2265 2% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1655) Placebo (n=1652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine tablets and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3%, 1.6%), and nausea (3%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QT c interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F 1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the perinatal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F 1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F 1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F 0 dams. F 1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F 2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother\u2019s clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) .] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution has not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ).] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ).] 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by one hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28 day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c : Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QT c ) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QT c (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QT c (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u00b7hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablets. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1,196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6 fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hrs in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2 and 1.9 fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and eight subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4 fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23 day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2 year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2 year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4 week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3. Table 3:TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 2 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline * ( SEM) Change from Baseline\u2020 (SEM) Placebo Comparison ( P - value) Desloratadine 5 mg (171) 14.2 (0.3) -4.3 (0.3) P <0.01 Placebo (173) 13.7 (0.3) -2.5 (0.3) SEM=Standard Error of the Mean *At baseline, a total nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 6 and a total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of at least 5 (each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. \u2020Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2 week treatment period. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).

In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, desloratadine tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy desloratadine tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"Number of Hives\" and the \"Size of the Largest Hive,\" when compared to placebo.

The clinical safety of desloratadine oral solution was documented in three, 15 day, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of desloratadine oral solution administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of desloratadine oral solution was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1 mg of desloratadine oral solution was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of desloratadine oral solution in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22652% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 ).] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets , 5 mg ( n = 1655 ) Placebo ( n = 1652 ) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC- based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri- natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.1 ).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]."

Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post-marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the desloratadine product. In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day somnolence was reported. In another study, no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0 to 24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 ).] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets , 5 mg ( n = 1655 ) Placebo ( n = 1652 ) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC- based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri- natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.1 ).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0 to 24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.

TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. **Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine tablets in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).

Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1.

There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were (rates for Desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F 1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the perinatal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F 1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F 1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F 0 dams. F 1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F 2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [ See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) .] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of Desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Desloratadine Tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets or Desloratadine Oral Solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . ] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15-35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5-mg dose of Oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25-2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg dose of Desloratadine Oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51-69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34-43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5-29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with Desloratadine Tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with Desloratadine Tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2 ), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QTc: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15-35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg Desloratadine Tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5-mg dose of Oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25-2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg dose of Desloratadine Oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51-69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34-43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5-29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with Desloratadine Tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with Desloratadine Tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106-108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of Desloratadine Tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of Desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, Desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering Desloratadine Tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3 .

A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of Desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4). Table 4 TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TSS) Changes in a 4 Week Clinical Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Group (n) Mean Baseline At baseline, average of total symptom score (sum of 5 individual nasal symptoms and 3 non-nasal symptoms, each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) of at least 10 was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. (SEM) Change from Baseline Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 4 week treatment period.

In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, Desloratadine Tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"Number of Hives\" and the \"Size of the Largest Hive,\" when compared to placebo.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . ] The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22652% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2,834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1,655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1655) Placebo (n=1652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3%, 1.6%), and nausea (3%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders : tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders : psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations : elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders : hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders : increased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal impairment: dosage adjustment is recommended ( 2.5 , 8.6 , 12.3 ) Hepatic impairment: dosage adjustment is recommended ( 2.5 , 8.7 , 12.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with desloratadine in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are no adequate and well\u2011controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)\u2011based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F 1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC-based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri-and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri-natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F 1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F 1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F 0 dams. F 1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F 2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother\u2019s clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The desloratadine orally disintegrating 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet and the previously marketed orally disintegrating tablet was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identifiied differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c : Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QT c ) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QT c (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QT c (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 24 adult volunteers. A single desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single 5 mg desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets (original formulation) for both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine. Food and water had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1,575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1,196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of Oral Solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. The desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet and the original desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose-finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC0-24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c : Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QT c ) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QT c (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QT c (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 24 adult volunteers. A single desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single 5 mg desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets (original formulation) for both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine. Food and water had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1,575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1,196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of Oral Solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. The desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet and the original desloratadine orally disintegrating tablet was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose-finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for desloratadine orally disintegrating tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC0-24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male\u2011specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2,300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1,838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks\u2019 duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.

TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. \u2020 Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1,300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks\u2019 duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).

In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, desloratadine significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy desloratadine 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \u201cNumber of Hives\u201d and the \u201cSize of the Largest Hive,\u201d when compared to placebo.

In the first study, 2.5 mg of desloratadine was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of desloratadine administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of desloratadine was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 mg of desloratadine was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of desloratadine in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22652% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 ).] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets , 5 mg ( n = 1655 ) Placebo ( n = 1652 ) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritus Nervous system disorders: psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis) Investigations: elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increased appetite"

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC- based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri- natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine. There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.1 ).] 8.4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with desloratadine in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H 1 -receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H 1 -receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro . Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H 1 -receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown. Effects on QT c Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng\u2219hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C max and AUC) of desloratadine. The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C max ) of desloratadine oral solution. Distribution Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out. Elimination The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14 C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half-life values compared to desloratadine. Special Populations Geriatric Subjects: In older subjects (\u226565 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects \u226565 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects. Pediatric Subjects: In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C max and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution. A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution. Renally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Hepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 )]. Gender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C max and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended. Race: Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. Drug Interactions: In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0 to 24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. Genotoxicity Studies In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD)."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Studies The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%). In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma. Desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.

TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms. **Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. 14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine tablets in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).
