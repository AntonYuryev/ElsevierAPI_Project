      "DESCRIPTION Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules for oral administration each contain 20 mg or 30 mg of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker). Nicardipine hydrochloride is a dihydropyridine structure with the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical name 2-(benzyl-methyl amino)ethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(m-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate monohydrochloride, and it has the following structure: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a greenish-yellow, odorless, crystalline powder that melts at about 169\u00b0C. It is freely soluble in chloroform, methanol and glacial acetic acid, sparingly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in n-butanol, water, 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, acetone and dioxane, very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and practically insoluble in benzene, ether and hexane. It has a molecular weight of 515.99. Each capsule, for oral administration, contains 20 mg or 30 mg of nicardipine hydrochloride. In addition, each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, titanium dioxide, gelatin and FD&C Blue #1. The colorants used in the capsules are black iron oxide, FD&C Blue #2, FD&C Red #40, D&C Yellow #10 and FD&C Blue #1. In addition, the 30 mg capsules also contain propylene glycol. structure-formula"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsulese bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary Steal\u201d, the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) have been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: Table 1 SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function: Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function: When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels though nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3 month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels though nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3 month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsuels dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS : Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safety coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blocker (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Population Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impair renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent IV Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site ( 5.7 )] . \u200b2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Flexible Containers Dilution is not required for Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not combine Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Preparation for administration 1. Suspend container from eyelet support. 2. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes \u00b1 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6) ]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a TID regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use in patients with advanced aortic stenosis ( 4.1 ). 4.1 Advanced Aortic Stenosis Do not use nicardipine in patients with advanced aortic stenosis because of the afterload reduction effect of nicardipine. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "\u200b6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are headache (13%), hypotension (5%), tachycardia (4%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7.3 ). Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ]. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 mg/hr to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 mg/hr to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity.

Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 mg/hr to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 mg/hr to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing (2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Single Dose Containers Dilution is not required for Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not combine Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Discard Unused Portion Preparation for administration 1. Suspend container from eyelet support. 2. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6) ]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use in patients with advanced aortic stenosis ( 4.1 ). 4.1 Advanced Aortic Stenosis Do not use nicardipine in patients with advanced aortic stenosis because of the afterload reduction effect of nicardipine. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are headache (13%), hypotension (5%), tachycardia (4%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7.3 ). Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] ."

      "8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant."

Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity.

( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension niCARdipine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing niCARdipine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted 0.1 mg/mL before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to an Oral Antihypertensive Agent Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjust to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally clear, yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG/ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. The diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature."

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact American Regent, Inc. at 1-800-734-9236, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Table 2 shows percentage of patients with adverse reactions where the rate is >3% more common on nicardipine hydrochloride injection than placebo.

      "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases oral nicardipine plasma levels. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine hydrochloride injection. ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Minimally excreted into human milk. ( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event includes acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was < 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event includes acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day).

One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient ingested 2160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of < 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and < 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) ]. Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (> 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( 7.3 , 7.4 ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits.

Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild to moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 20.7 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure \u2264 95 mmHg or \u2265 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure \u2264 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5.2 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as \u2265 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 11.5 \u00b1 0.8 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg per mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr=5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr=12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr=22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Conversion Table (mg/hr) Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg per mL) 5 mg/hr 50 mL/hr 2.5 mg/hr 25 mL/hr 15 mg/hr 150 mL/hr If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 3-5 mg/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted to 0.1 mg per mL before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table : Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent lntravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg per mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Nicardipine Hydrochloride Injection 25 mg in 10 mL (2.5 mg per mL) Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to an Oral Antihypertensive Agent Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Special Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 )] . 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be restarted at low doses such as 30-50 mL/hr (3 - 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is available as a single-dose solution for intravenous administration. Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspect nicardipine hydrochloride injection visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally yellow in color. Do not combine nicardipine hydrochloride injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Protect from light until ready to use. Preparation for administration Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG PER ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg per mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. The diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased Effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged Effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia.

Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine hydrochloride injection. ( 7.3, 7.4 ) 7.1 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta blockers. However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Minimally excreted into human milk. ( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily.

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient, 2,160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one year old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1\u2212half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( 7.3, 7.4 ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human IV doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous IV infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride was administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride was given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady- state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride produces a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end- diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride does, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal,\" the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. nicardipine hydrochloride does not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride was demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride given three times daily are shown in the following table: Table 1 SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride further lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride decreases peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride is subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. nicardipine hydrochloride usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride is initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma ( in vitro ), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T 4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T 4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. nicardipine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine hydrochloride in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride decreases peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride is subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. nicardipine hydrochloride usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride is initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma ( in vitro ), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered.",

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use with Other Antianginal Agents 1. Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. 2. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. 3. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS : Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use with Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Populations Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride impairs renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ).",
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Discard unused portion. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 ) ]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ).",

Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1- half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent IV Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site ( 5.7 )] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes \u00b1 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6) ]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a TID regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7.3 ). Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ]. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 mg/hr to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 mg/hr to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 mg/hr to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 mg/hr to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site ( 5.7 )] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Containers Dilution is not required for nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not combine nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Discard unused Portion Preparation for administration Suspend container from eyelet support. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 )] . 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.3 )] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary steal\" has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent IV Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Discard unused portion. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes \u00b1 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 )] . 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a TID regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta- blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient\u2019s clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mm Hg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta- blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep- vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embyolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6) ]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30-50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted to 0.1 mg/mL before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown Table 1: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to Oral Antihypertensive Agents Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30-50 mL/hr (3-5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG/ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP.

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment.

However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Minimally excreted into human milk. ( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9-18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3-13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples.

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9-18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3-13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples.

      "10. OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "description": [
      "11. DESCRIPTION Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection for intravenous administration contains 2.5 mg/mL of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride is a dihydropyridine derivative with IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical name (\u00b1)-2-(benzyl-methyl amino) ethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-( m -nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate monohydrochloride and has the following structure: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a greenish-yellow, odorless, crystalline powder that melts at about 169\u00b0C. It is freely soluble in chloroform, methanol, and glacial acetic acid, sparingly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in n-butanol, water, 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, acetone, and dioxane, very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and practically insoluble in benzene, ether, and hexane. It has a molecular weight of 515.99. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is available as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, yellow solution in 10 mL vials for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each mL contains 2.5 mg nicardipine hydrochloride in water for injection with 48 mg sorbitol. Buffered with 0.525 mg citric acid monohydrate and 0.09 mg sodium hydroxide. Additional citric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH. Nicardipine Hydrochloride structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection (nicardipine hydrochloride) was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) ]. Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (> 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( 7.3 , 7.4 ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits.

CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild to moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 20.7 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure \u226495 mmHg or \u226525 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure \u2264160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5.2 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as \u226515% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 11.5 \u00b1 0.8 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension niCARdipine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing niCARdipine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted 0.1 mg/mL before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to an Oral Antihypertensive Agent Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjust to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally clear, yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG/ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP.

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact American Regent, Inc. at 1-800-734-9236, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Table 2 shows percentage of patients with adverse reactions where the rate is >3% more common on nicardipine hydrochloride injection than placebo.

      "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases oral nicardipine plasma levels. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine hydrochloride injection. ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event includes acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was < 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was < 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant."

Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10. OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient ingested 2160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of < 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and < 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) ]. Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (> 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( 7.3 , 7.4 ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30 mg oral dose at steady\u2011state. When nicardipine hydrochloride was administered 1 hour or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride was given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36 ng/mL, 88 ng/mL, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 mg to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 mg to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30 mg and 40 mg doses at steady\u2011state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 hours to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 days to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride is highly protein bound (> 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30 mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically\u2011confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20 mg nicardipine hydrochloride bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride in elderly hypertensive patients (\u2265 65 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride produces a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 beats to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride does, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary Steal,\u201d the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His\u2011Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1. PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride (20 mg to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose\u2011related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 hour and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo\u2011controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride was demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo\u2011controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo-controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo\u2011control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride further lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30 mg and 40 mg doses at steady\u2011state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations).

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE I. Stable Angina Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the management of patients with chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina). Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta\u2011blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 days to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride decreases peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 hour to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride is subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride is initiated. Maalox \u00ae 2 Co-administration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma ( in vitro ), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5 mg/kg/day, 15 mg/kg/day or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3\u2011month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T 4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T 4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well\u2011controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine hydrochloride in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u2265 65 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered at doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride decreases peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 hour to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride is subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride is initiated. Maalox \u00ae 2 Co-administration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma ( in vitro ), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1,910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride (n = 520) and placebo (n = 310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 times to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 mg to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use with Other Antianginal Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co\u2011administered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 hour to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 hour to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use with Other Antihypertensive Agents Diuretics: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co\u2011administered with thiazide diuretics. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Populations Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impairs renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u200bMechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary Steal,\u201d the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1. PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough / Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "\u200bMechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary Steal,\u201d the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1. PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough / Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure ecause nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox\u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents 1. Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. 2. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. 3. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS : Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Populations Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impairs renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride was administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride was given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics: In man, nicardipine hydrochloride produces a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride does, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal,\" the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects: In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1. PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function: There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris: In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride was demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension: Nicardipine hydrochloride produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride further lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE I. Stable Angina: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the management of patients with chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina). Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina: About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure: Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal: Nicardipine hydrochloride is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Blood Pressure: Because nicardipine hydrochloride decreases peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function: Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride is subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function: When nicardipine hydrochloride 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions: Beta-Blockers: In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine: Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin: Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride is initiated. Maalox \u00ae 2 : Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T 4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T 4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine hydrochloride in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride. Angina: The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category).

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina: The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents 1. Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. 2. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. 3. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions). Hypertension: The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS : Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride impairs renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Nicardipine hydrochloride should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure: Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Discard unused portion. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady-state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 )] . 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient\u2019s clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta- blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep- vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady-state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6) ]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After co-administration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady-state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6) ]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After co-administration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes.

For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). \u2022 When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr \u2022 In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). \u2022 If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Containers Dilution is not required for nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not combine nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Discard Unused Portion Preparation for administration 1. Suspend container from eyelet support. 2. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 ) ] . 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7.3 ). Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine ( 7.5 , 7.6 ) 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3 -half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6) ]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

      "HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION These highlights do not include all the information needed to use NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE safely and effectively. See full prescribing information for NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE. NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE injection, for intravenous use Initial U.S. Approval: 1988 RECENT MAJOR CHANGES Dosage and Administration ( 2- 2.2) 04/2016 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. ( 1 ) DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2- 2.1). Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2- 2.2). When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2- 2.3): In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2- 2.4). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 to 5 mg/hr (2.5). DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 25 mg/10 mL (2.5 mg/mL) single-dose vial ( 3 ) 20 mg in 200 mL (0.1 mg/mL) flexible container ( 3 ) 40 mg in 200 mL (0.2 mg/mL) flexible container ( 3 ) CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use in patients with advanced aortic stenosis ( 4- 4.1). WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5- 5.7). To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5- 5.7). Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5- 5.8). Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5- 5.3), congestive heart failure (5.4), impaired hepatic function ( 5- 5.5), portal hypertension ( 5- 5.5), and renal impairment ( 5- 5.6) and pheochromocytoma ( 5- 5.9). ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are headache (13%), hypotension (5%), tachycardia (4%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. ( 6 ) DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7- 7.3). Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7- 7.5, 7- 7.6). USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8- 8.1). Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8- 8.3). Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8- 8.4).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site ( 5- 5.7)]. 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Flexible Containers Dilution is not required for Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not combine Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Preparation for administration 1. Suspend container from eyelet support. 2. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes \u00b1 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5- 5.4, 5- 5.5 and 5- 5.6)]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a TID regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. DOSAGE"

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5- 5.4)]. 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embyolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3)]. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and Cmax were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted to 0.1 mg/mL before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown Table 1: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent lntravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to Oral Antihypertensive Agents Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG/ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.

The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Table 2 shows percentage of patients with adverse events where the rate is >3% more common on nicardipine hydrochloride injection than placebo.

( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was <0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1\u2212half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (7.3, 7.4). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1\u2212half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (7.3, 7.4). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild to moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 20.7 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure \u226495 mmHg or \u226525 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure \u2264160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5.2 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as \u226515% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 11.5 \u00b1 0.8 minutes.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For Intravenous Use. (2.1) \u2022 No further dilution is required. (2.3) \u2022 When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below (2.1): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion rate (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.2 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 0.5 mg/hr = 2.5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 1.2 mg/hr = 6 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr 2.2 mg/hr = 11 mL/hr \u2022 In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. (2.1) Conversion Table (mg/hr) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.2 mg/mL) 5 mg/hr 50 mL/hr 25 mL/hr 2.5 mg/hr 25 mL/hr 12.5 mL/hr 15 mg/hr 150 mL/hr 75 mL/hr \u2022 If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 3 to 5 mg/hr. (2.2) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate 20 mg in 200 mL (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate 40 mg in 200mL (0.2 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 0.5 mg/hr = 2.5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 1.2 mg/hr = 6 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr 2.2 mg/hr = 11 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 20 mg in 200 mL (0.1 mg/mL): Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 40 mg in 200 mL (0.2 mg/mL): Initiate therapy at 25 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 12.5 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 75 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 15 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to an Oral Antihypertensive Agent Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Special Populations Titrate Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 and 5.4)] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, infusion of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection may be restarted at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) for 20 mg in 200 mL or 15 to 25 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) for 40 mg in 200 mL and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available as a single-dose, ready-to-use, iso-osmotic solution for intravenous administration. No further dilution is required. Inspect Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is normally a clear, colorless to yellow solution. Do not combine Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Preparation for administration 1 Suspend container from eyelet support. 2 Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3 Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set. 4 Discard unused portion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) \u2022 To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. (5.5) \u2022 To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection every 12 hours. (5.5) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact WG Critical Care, LLC at 1-866-562-4708, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. The table below shows percentage of patients with adverse events where the rate is >3% more common on Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection than placebo.

(8.3) \u2022 Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface are (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was < 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one year old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker). Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for intravenous administration contains 20 mg (0.1 mg/mL) of nicardipine hydrochloride per 200 mL in sodium chloride or 40 mg (0.2 mg/mL) of nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride per 200 mL in sodium chloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride is a dihydropyridine derivative with IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical name (\u00b1)-2-(benzyl-methyl amino) ethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-( m -nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate monohydrochloride and has the following structure: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a greenish-yellow, odorless, crystalline powder that melts at about 169\u00baC. It is freely soluble in chloroform, methanol, and glacial acetic acid, sparingly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in n-butanol, water, 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, acetone, and dioxane, very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and practically insoluble in benzene, ether, and hexane. It has a molecular weight of 515.99. Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available as a ready-to-use sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless to yellow, iso-osmotic solution for intravenous administration in a 200 mL Renolit Solmed Infuflex \u00ae container with 20 mg (0.1 mg/mL) or 40 mg (0.2 mg/mL) nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride. Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.86% Sodium Chloride Injection 20 mg in 200 mL (0.1 mg/mL) Each mL contains 0.1 mg nicardipine hydrochloride, 8.6 mg sodium chloride, USP, 0.0192 mg citric acid, anhydrous, USP, and 1.92 mg sorbitol, NF. Sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH to 3.7 to 4.7. Nicardipine Hydrochloride in 0.83% Sodium Chloride Injection 40 mg in 200 mL (0.2 mg/mL) Each mL contains 0.2 mg nicardipine hydrochloride, 8.3 mg sodium chloride, USP, 0.0384 mg citric acid, anhydrous, USP, and 3.84 mg sorbitol, NF. Sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH to 3.7 to 4.7. The Renolit Solmed Infuflex \u00ae container is fabricated from multilayered plastic. Solutions are in contact with the polyethylene layer of the container and can leach out certain chemical components of the plastic in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability and safety of the plastic have been confirmed in tests in animals according to the USP biological tests for plastic containers, as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies. chemical structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute bolus administration of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2Cl9). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (7.3, 7.4). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute bolus administration of Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human IV doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous IV infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 20.7 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), Nicardipine hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure \u226495 mmHg or \u226525 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure \u2264160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5.2 minutes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus ( see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary Steal\u201d, the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) have been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: Table 1 SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE I. Stable Angina Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the management of patients with chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina). Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine hydrochloride it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function: Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function: When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels though nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3 month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category).

Adverse events in this category each occurred in <0.4% of patients receiving nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and included myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, exertional hypotension, pericarditis, heart block, cerebral ischemia, and ventricular tachycardia. It is possible that some of these events were drug-related. Hypertension The incidence rates of adverse effects in hypertensive patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n= 1390) and placebo (n= 211), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator. Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effect was pedal edema.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS : Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safety coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blocker (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Population Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impair renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg per mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted to 0.1 mg per mL before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown Table 1 : Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg per mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to Oral Antihypertensive Agents Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )]. 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG per ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg per mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. The diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effects with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are headache (15%), hypotension (6%), tachycardia (4%) and nausea/vomiting (5%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Table 2 shows percentage of patients with adverse reactions where the rate is >3% more common on nicardipine hydrochloride injection than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cimetidine increases oral nicardipine plasma levels. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine hydrochloride injection. ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Minimally excreted into human milk. ( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse event include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was <0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was <0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant."

Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient, 2,160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection, USP for intravenous administration contains 2.5 mg per mL of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride is a dihydropyridine derivative with IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical name (\u00b1)-2-(benzyl-methyl amino) ethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(m-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate monohydrochloride and has the following structure: Nicardipine hydrochloride is a greenish-yellow, odorless, crystalline powder that melts at about 169\u00b0C. It is freely soluble in chloroform, methanol, and glacial acetic acid, sparingly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in n-butanol, water, 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, acetone, and dioxane, very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and practically insoluble in benzene, ether, and hexane. It has a molecular weight of 515.99. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection, USP is available as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, yellow solution in 10 mL vials for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each mL contains 2.5 mg nicardipine hydrochloride in water for injection with 48 mg sorbitol. Buffered with 0.525 mg citric acid monohydrate and 0.09 mg sodium hydroxide. Additional citric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection (nicardipine hydrochloride) was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1\u2212half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 , 7.4 )] . The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human IV doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous IV infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half- life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal\", the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from under perfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously under perfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) have been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo- controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours post-dose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: Table 1 SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine hydrochloride it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function: Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half- life (19 hours) of nicardipine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function: When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Beta Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox\u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3 month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta- blockers (see Drug Interactions ) . Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents Diuretics: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safety co-administered with thiazide diuretics. Beta-blockers: nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta-blocker (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) Special Patient Population Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impair renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. ( 1 ) 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Individualize dosage based upon the severity of hypertension and response of the patient during dosing ( 2.1 ). \u2022 Single dose vials must be diluted before use ( 2.2 ). \u2022 When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr \u2022 In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). \u2022 If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ). 2.1 General Information Individualize dosing based on the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate both during and after the infusion to avoid tachycardia or too rapid or excessive reduction in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Administer Nicardipine Hydrochloride by slow continuous infusion by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Intravenous Infusion Site (5.7) ] . 2.2 Inspection and Preparation Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if particulate matter, precipitate, or crystallization is present, or if the container appears damaged. Single Dose Vials Dilution Single dose vials must be diluted before infusion. Each vial (25 mg) must be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Compatability Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found compatible and stable in polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Discard unused portion. 2.3 Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in the following table: Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr 2.4 Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Drug-Free Patient The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. When treating acute hypertensive episodes in patients with chronic hypertension, discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in 30 minutes plus/minus 7 minutes but plasma levels of drug and gradually decreasing antihypertensive effects exist for many hours. Titration For a gradual reduction in blood pressure, initiate therapy at a rate of 5 mg/hr. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr, until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For more rapid blood pressure reduction, titrate every 5 minutes. Maintenance Adjust the rate of infusion as needed to maintain desired response. 2.5 Conditions Requiring Infusion Adjustment Hypotension or Tachycardia: In case of hypotension or tachycardia, discontinue infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart infusion at low doses such as 30 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr (3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr) and titrate to maintain desired blood pressure. Infusion Site Changes: Change infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein. Impaired Cardiac, Hepatic, or Renal Function: Monitor closely when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride injection in patients with congestive heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.5 and 5.6 )]. 2.6 Transfer to Oral Antihypertensive Agents If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than nicardipine capsules, initiate oral therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. When switching to a three times a day regimen of nicardipine capsules, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \u2022 Do not use in patients with advanced aortic stenosis ( 4.1 ). 4.1 Advanced Aortic Stenosis Do not use nicardipine in patients with advanced aortic stenosis because of the afterload reduction effect of nicardipine. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Avoid intraarterial administration or extravasation ( 5.7 ). \u2022 To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine every 12 hours ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually ( 5.8 ). \u2022 Closely monitor response in patients with angina ( 5.3 ), congestive heart failure ( 5.4 ), impaired hepatic function ( 5.5 ), portal hypertension ( 5.5 ), and renal impairment ( 5.6 ) and pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Excessive Pharmacologic Effects In administrating nicardipine, close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is required. Nicardipine may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. Avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. 5.2 Rapid Decreases in Blood Pressure No clinical events have been reported suggestive of a too rapid decrease in blood pressure with nicardipine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, blood pressure lowering should be accomplished over as long a time as is compatible with the patient's clinical status. 5.3 Use in Patients with Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with nicardipine capsules. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.4 Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Nicardipine reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility in preliminary hemodynamic studies of CHF patients. However, in vitro and in some patients, a negative inotropic effect has been observed. Therefore, monitor vital signs carefully when using nicardipine, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with CHF or significant left ventricular dysfunction. 5.5 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor response. Nicardipine administered intravenously increased hepatic venous pressure gradient by 4 mmHg in cirrhotic patients at high doses (5 mg/20 min) in one study. Use caution in patients with portal hypertension. 5.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher AUC was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Careful dose titration is advised when treating patients with more than mild renal impairment. 5.7 Intravenous Infusion Site To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the rare occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, consider changing the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours. 5.8 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Withdraw beta-blockers gradually. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Only limited clinical experience exists in use of nicardipine for patients with hypertension from pheochromocytoma."

( 6 ) 6.1 Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse reactions occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. Adverse reactions that occurred more often on nicardipine than on placebo by at least 2% were headache (13%) and nausea/vomiting (4%). The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or in the literature during the use of intravenously administered nicardipine. Body as a Whole: fever, neck pain Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, ST segment depression, inverted T wave, deep-vein thrombophlebitis Digestive: dyspepsia Hemic and Lymphatic: thrombocytopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema Nervous: confusion, hypertonia Respiratory: respiratory disorder Special Senses: conjunctivitis, ear disorder, tinnitus Urogenital: urinary frequency Sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels ( 7.3 ). \u2022 Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. ( 7.5 , 7.6 ). 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 7.2 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.4 Digoxin Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.6 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.7 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). \u2022 Nursing Mothers: It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug ( 8.3 ). \u2022 Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. There are limited human data in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, evidence of fetal harm was observed. Therefore use nicardipine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, increased embryolethality occurred when nicardipine was administered intravenously at doses equivalent to human intravenous doses of 1.6 (rats) and 0.32 mg/kg/day (rabbits). Increased embryolethality was also observed when nicardipine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 48 mg/kg/day (a dose 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and one associated with marked maternal body weight gain suppression). At a lower oral dose, equivalent to a human dose of about 32 mg/kg/day (16 times the maximum recommended human oral dose), in a different strain of rabbit, there were no adverse effects on the fetus, though there was increased maternal mortality. There was no evidence of embyolethality or teratogenicity when pregnant rats were administered nicardipine orally at a dose equivalent to a human oral dose of about 16 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD); however, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were reported [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3) ] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. It is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not be given this drug. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 days to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 women received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (less than 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and concomitant disease of other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine immediate release capsules, and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1- half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6 )] . The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One-month and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryolethality, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effects in Hypertension In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic stable essential hypertension, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 21 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative hypertension), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg or greater or equal to 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 160 mmHg, was 77 \u00b1 5 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8.0 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative hypertension, defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 12 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) No further dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.2 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 0.5 mg/hr =2.5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 1.2 mg/hr = 6 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr 2.2 mg/hr = 11 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Conversion Table (mg/hr) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.2 mg/mL) 5 mg/hr 50 mL/hr 25 mL/hr 2.5 mg/hr 25 mL/hr 12.5 mL/hr 15 mg/hr 150 mL/hr 75 mL/hr If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30-50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in Table 1: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) Equivalent I.V. Infusion Rate (0.2 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 0.5 mg/hr =2.5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 1.2 mg/hr = 6 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr 2.2 mg/hr = 11 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to Oral Antihypertensive Agents Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Special Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] . 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30-50 mL/hr (3 - 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is available as a single-dose vial, - Inspect Nicardipine hydrochloride injection visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Check the container for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly; ensure that the seal is intact. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally a clear, colorless to yellow solution. Do not combine Nicardipine hydrochloride injection with any product in the same intravenous line or premixed container. Do not add supplementary medication to the bag. Protect from light until ready to use. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Preparation for Administration \u2022 Suspend container from eyelet support. \u2022 Remove protector from outlet port at a bottom of container. \u2022 Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic oral therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased Effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged Effects with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia. The table below shows percentage of patients with adverse reactions where the rate is > 3% more common on nicardipine hydrochloride injection than placebo.

( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH < 7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 \u2013 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 \u2013 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (< 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was < 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of < 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and < 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals * or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. * PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (> 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (> 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr \u00b7 kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (7.3, 7.4). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of < 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and < 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals * or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. * PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human IV doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous IV infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weight, reduced neonatal survival and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are two-fold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine does not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately two-fold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and four-fold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride produces a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride does, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal,\" the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride was demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 52 -10.3 -17.6 -4.9 -7.9 48% 45% 20 mg 50 52 -10.6 -9.0 -4.6 -2.9 43% 32% 30 mg 45 44 -14.5 -14.6 -7.2 -7.5 50% 51% 30 mg 45 44 -12.8 -14.2 -4.9 -4.3 38% 30% 40 mg 50 38 -16.3 -15.9 -9.5 -6.0 58% 38% 40 mg 50 38 -15.4 -14.8 -5.9 -3.7 38% 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine hydrochloride produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride is completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are two-fold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine does not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately two-fold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and four-fold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride produces a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride does, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal,\" the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride, and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride does not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride (20 to 40 mg) has been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo-controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride was demonstrated at 8 hours postdose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride given three times daily are shown in the following table: SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 52 -10.3 -17.6 -4.9 -7.9 48% 45% 20 mg 50 52 -10.6 -9.0 -4.6 -2.9 43% 32% 30 mg 45 44 -14.5 -14.6 -7.2 -7.5 50% 51% 30 mg 45 44 -12.8 -14.2 -4.9 -4.3 38% 30% 40 mg 50 38 -16.3 -15.9 -9.5 -6.0 58% 38% 40 mg 50 38 -15.4 -14.8 -5.9 -3.7 38% 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group.

Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with beta-blockers. II. Hypertension: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In administering nicardipine it is important to be aware of the relatively large peak to trough differences in blood pressure effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules is secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (four-fold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately two-fold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules is initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T 4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T 4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules is suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (four-fold increase in AUC) and prolonged half-life (19 hours) of nicardipine hydrochloride (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately two-fold higher in renally impaired patients than in healthy controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Beta-Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules is initiated. Maalox \u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride was not altered."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T 4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T 4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg)."

      "Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose US and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents 1. Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. 2. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. 3. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents 1. Diuretics: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with thiazide diuretics. 2. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely coadministered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Special Patient Populations Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impair renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. For prolonged control of blood pressure, transfer patients to oral medication as soon as their clinical condition permits [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use. ( 2.1 ) Dilution is required. ( 2.3 ) When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate from the table below ( 2.1 ): Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr In a patient not receiving oral nicardipine, initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr) 0.1 mg/mL solution. Increase the infusion rate by 25 mL/hr every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. ( 2.1 ) If unacceptable hypotension or tachycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. When blood pressure and heart rate stabilize, restart the infusion at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Vial must be diluted to 0.1 mg/mL before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown Table 1: Table 1: Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Hydrochloride Dose Equivalent lntravenous Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr). If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr). Drug Discontinuation and Transition to Oral Antihypertensive Agents Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset action in about 30 minutes. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4 )] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to fall within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion and avoid too rapid or excessive blood pressure drop during treatment. If there is concern of impending hypotension or tachycardia, the infusion should be discontinued. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Preparation for Administration Vials must be diluted before infusion. Inspection As with all parenteral drugs, nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is normally yellow in color. Dilution Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is administered by slow continuous infusion at a CONCENTRATION OF 0.1 MG/ML. Each vial (25 mg) should be diluted with 240 mL of compatible intravenous fluid (see below), resulting in 250 mL of solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been found to be compatible and stable in glass or polyvinyl chloride containers for 24 hours at controlled room temperature with: Dextrose (5%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) and Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Dextrose (5%) with 40 mEq Potassium, USP Sodium Chloride (0.45%) Injection, USP Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is NOT compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Closely monitor response in patients with angina, heart failure, impaired hepatic function, or renal impairment. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Exercise extreme care to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. ( 5.5 ) To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection every 12 hours. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina Increases in frequency, duration, or severity of angina have been seen in chronic therapy with oral nicardipine. Induction or exacerbation of angina has been seen in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. The mechanism of this effect has not been established. 5.2 Exacerbation of Heart Failure Titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker, in patients with heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction because of possible negative inotropic effects. 5.3 Increased effect with Impaired Hepatic Function Since nicardipine is metabolized in the liver, consider lower dosages and closely monitor responses in patients with impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. 5.4 Prolonged effect with Impaired Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment, a significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) was observed. These results are consistent with those seen after oral administration of nicardipine. Titrate gradually in patients with renal impairment. 5.5 Local Irritation To reduce the possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, local irritation, swelling, extravasation, and the occurrence of vascular impairment, administer drug through large peripheral veins or central veins rather than arteries or small peripheral veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. To minimize the risk of peripheral venous irritation, change the site of the drug infusion every 12 hours."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to hypotension, headache, and tachycardia.

Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine hydrochloride injection ( 7.3 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Beta-Blockers In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, titrate slowly when using nicardipine hydrochloride injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.2 Cimetidine Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 7.3 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 7.4 Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. 7.5 In Vitro Interaction The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Minimally excreted into human milk. ( 8.3 ) Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers. In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, 4 women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 to 80 mg daily, 6 received sustained-release nicardipine 100 to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose. In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (<5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine.

Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data in pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available. In animal studies, no embryotoxicity occurred in rats with oral doses 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ), but did occur in rabbits with oral doses at 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Nicardipine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women who were treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events. Adverse events in women treated with intravenous nicardipine during pre-term labor include pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and phlebitis at site of injection. Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25). In embryofetal toxicity studies, nicardipine was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.14 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (5 mg/kg/day) (rats) and 0.03 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (0.5 mg/kg/day) (rabbits). No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at these doses. Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity was seen at 0.27 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (10 mg/kg/day) in rats and at 0.05 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (1 mg/kg/day) in rabbits. In other animal studies, pregnant Japanese White rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses 8 and 24 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (50 and 150 mg/kg/day). Embryotoxicity occurred at the high dose along with signs of maternal toxicity (marked maternal weight gain suppression). New Zealand albino rabbits received oral nicardipine during organogenesis, at doses up to 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg nicardipine/kg/day). While significant maternal mortality occurred, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. Pregnant rats received oral nicardipine from day 6 through day 15 of gestation at doses up to 8 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (100 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity; however, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of immediate-release oral nicardipine, and another patient, 2,160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal overdose may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdosage, implement standard measures including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions. Position the patient so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Use vasopressors for patients exhibiting profound hypotension."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of <5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and <3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) was given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with nephropathy, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, oral nicardipine improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse experiences reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease are similar to all patients treated with oral nicardipine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (>65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1\u2212half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u03b2-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u03b3-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d ) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism, however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (7.3, 7.4). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."

One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Embryotoxicity, but no teratogenicity, was seen at intravenous doses of 10 mg nicardipine/kg/day in rats and 1 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses in the rat and rabbit are equivalent to human intravenous doses of about 1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day respectively. (The total daily human dose delivered by a continuous intravenous infusion ranges from 1.2 to 6 mg/kg/day, depending on duration at different infusion rates ranging from 3 to 15 mg/hr as individual patients are titrated for optimal results.) Nicardipine was also embryotoxic when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe), but not at 50 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day or about 8 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated orally, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are a calcium entry blocker (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels that cause little or no negative inotropic effect. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed following oral doses administered as capsules. Plasma levels are detectable as early as 20 minutes following an oral dose and maximal plasma levels are observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours (mean T max = 1 hour). While nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are completely absorbed, it is subject to saturable first pass metabolism and the systemic bioavailability is about 35% following a 30-mg oral dose at steady-state. When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered 1 or 3 hours after a high-fat meal, the mean C max and mean AUC were lower (20% to 30%) than when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were given to fasting subjects. These decreases in plasma levels observed following a meal may be significant, but the clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were done in patients without regard to the timing of meals. Thus, the results of these trials reflect the effects of meal-induced variability. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Post-absorption kinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are also non-linear, although there is a reproducible terminal plasma half-life that averaged 8.6 hours following 30- and 40-mg doses at steady-state (tid). The terminal half-life represents the elimination of less than 5% of the absorbed drug (measured by plasma concentrations). Elimination over the first 8 hours after dosing is much faster with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 2 to 3 days of tid dosing (every 8 hours) and are twofold higher than after a single dose. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are highly protein bound (>95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are metabolized extensively by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine. Following a radioactive oral dose in solution, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 35% in feces. Most of the dose (over 90%) was recovered within 48 hours of dosing. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not induce its own metabolism, however, nicardipine causes inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (see Drug Interactions ). The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline serum creatinine concentration ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 mg/dL) than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride lid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients. Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are extensively metabolized by the liver, the plasma levels of the drug are influenced by changes in hepatic function. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with severe liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy or presence of endoscopically-confirmed esophageal varices) than in normal subjects. After 20-mg nicardipine hydrochloride capsules bid at steady-state, C max and AUC were 1.8 and fourfold higher, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to 19 hours in these patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules in elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) are similar to those obtained in young normal adults. After 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosing at 20 mg three times a day, the C max , T max , AUC, terminal plasma half-life and the extent of protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules observed in healthy elderly hypertensive patients did not differ significantly from those observed in young normal volunteers. Hemodynamics In man, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produce a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The degree of vasodilation and the resultant hypotensive effects are more prominent in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, nicardipine reduces the blood pressure at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise. In normotensive patients, a small decrease of about 9 mm Hg in systolic and 7 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure may accompany this fall in peripheral resistance. An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Although there is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increase coronary blood flow, there is no evidence that this property plays any role in its effectiveness in stable angina. In patients with coronary artery disease, intracoronary administration of nicardipine caused no direct myocardial depression. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do, however, have a negative inotropic effect in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and could, in patients with very impaired function, lead to worsened failure. \"Coronary Steal\", the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (diversion of blood from under perfused areas toward better perfused areas), has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle, and radio-nuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. Whether this represents steal in those patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear. In patients with coronary artery disease nicardipine improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction, and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Nicardipine hydrochloride increased the heart rate when given intravenously during acute electrophysiologic studies and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. The sinus node recovery times and SA conduction times were not affected by the drug. The PA, AH, and HV intervals 1 and the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged by nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and the relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened after intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. 1 PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium, AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection or AV nodal conduction time, HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Renal Function There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules do not cause generalized fluid retention, as measured by weight changes, although 7% to 8% of the patients experience pedal edema. Effects in Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks' duration in patients with chronic stable angina, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules increased exercise tolerance and reduced nitroglycerin consumption and the frequency of anginal attacks. The antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (20 to 40 mg) have been demonstrated in four placebo-controlled studies involving 258 patients with chronic stable angina. In exercise tolerance testing, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules significantly increased time to angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Included among these four studies was a dose-definition study in which dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance at 1 and 4 hours postdosing and reduced frequency of anginal attacks were seen at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg tid. Effectiveness at 10 mg tid was, however, marginal. In a fifth placebo- controlled study, the antianginal efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were demonstrated at 8 hours post-dose (trough). The sustained efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules have been demonstrated over long-term dosing. Blood pressure fell in patients with angina by about 10/8 mm Hg at peak blood levels and was little different from placebo at trough blood levels. Effects in Hypertension Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules produced dose-related decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in clinical trials. The antihypertensive efficacy of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules administered three times daily has been demonstrated in three placebo-controlled studies involving 517 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses in the three studies were statistically significant from placebo at peak (1 hour postdosing) and trough (8 hours postdosing) although it is apparent that well over half of the antihypertensive effect is lost by the end of the dosing interval. The results from placebo controlled studies of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules given three times daily are shown in the following table: Table 1 SYSTOLIC BP (mm Hg) DIASTOLIC BP (mm Hg) Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak Dose Number of Patients Mean Peak Response Mean Trough Response Trough/ Peak 20 mg 50 -10.3 -4.9 48% 20 mg 50 -10.6 -4.6 43% 52 -17.6 -7.9 45% 52 -9.0 -2.9 32% 30 mg 45 -14.5 -7.2 50% 30 mg 45 -12.8 -4.9 38% 44 -14.6 -7.5 51% 44 -14.2 -4.3 30% 40 mg 50 -16.3 -9.5 58% 40 mg 50 -15.4 -5.9 38% 38 -15.9 -6.0 38% 38 -14.8 -3.7 25% The responses are shown as differences from the concurrent placebo control group. The large changes between peak and trough effects were not accompanied by observed side effects at peak response times. In a study using 24-hour intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, the circadian variation in blood pressure remained unaltered, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced throughout the whole 24 hours. When added to beta-blocker therapy, nicardipine hydrochloride capsules further lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Because part of the effect of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Increased Angina About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Use in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 to 10 days."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Blood Pressure Because nicardipine hydrochloride capsules decrease peripheral resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are suggested. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules like other calcium channel blockers, may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. Caution is advised to avoid systemic hypotension when administering the drug to patients who have sustained an acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Because of prominent effects at the time of peak blood levels, initial titration should be performed with measurements of blood pressure at peak effect (1 to 2 hours after dosing) and just before the next dose. Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function: Since the liver is the major site of biotransformation and since nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are subject to first pass metabolism, the drug should be used with caution in patients having impaired liver function or reduced hepatic blood flow. Patients with severe liver disease developed elevated blood levels (fourfold increase in AUC) and prolonged half- life (19 hours) of nicardipine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Use in Patients With Impaired Renal Function: When nicardipine hydrochloride capsules 20 mg or 30 mg tid was given to hypertensive patients with mild renal impairment, mean plasma concentrations, AUC and C max were approximately twofold higher in renally impaired patients than in controls. Doses in these patients must be adjusted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Beta Blockers In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine Cimetidine increases nicardipine hydrochloride capsules plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules usually do not alter the plasma levels of digoxin; however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are initiated. Maalox\u00ae Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine hydrochloride capsules absorption. Fentanyl Anesthesia Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine hydrochloride capsules, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. Tacrolimus: Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were not altered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 2 years showed a dose-dependent increase in thyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia (follicular adenoma/carcinoma). One- and 3 month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for 1 year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the 40 mg tid maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man, assuming a patient weight of 60 kg). Pregnancy Nicardipine was embryocidal when administered orally to pregnant Japanese White rabbits, during organogenesis, at 150 mg/kg/day (a dose associated with marked body weight gain suppression in the treated doe) but not at 50 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum recommended antianginal or antihypertensive dose in man). No adverse effects on the fetus were observed when New Zealand albino rabbits were treated, during organogenesis, with up to 100 mg nicardipine/kg/day (a dose associated with significant mortality in the treated doe). In pregnant rats administered nicardipine orally at up to 100 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended human dose) there was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. However, dystocia, reduced birth weights, reduced neonatal survival, and reduced neonatal weight gain were noted. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown significant concentrations of nicardipine in maternal milk following oral administration. For this reason it is recommended that women who wish to breastfeed should not take this drug. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between elderly hypertensive patients (\u226565 years) and healthy controls after 1 week of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules treatment at 20 mg tid. Plasma nicardipine hydrochloride capsules concentrations in elderly hypertensive subjects were similar to plasma concentrations in healthy young adult subjects when nicardipine hydrochloride capsules were administered at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg tid, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are similar in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled short-term (up to 3 months) studies 1910 patients received nicardipine hydrochloride capsules alone or in combination with other drugs. In these studies adverse events were reported spontaneously; adverse experiences were generally not serious but occasionally required dosage adjustment and about 10% of patients left the studies prematurely because of them. Peak responses were not observed to be associated with adverse effects during clinical trials, but physicians should be aware that adverse effects associated with decreases in blood pressure (tachycardia, hypotension, etc.) could occur around the time of the peak effect. Most adverse effects were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Angina The incidence rates of adverse effects in anginal patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n=520) and placebo (n=310), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more. These represent events considered probably drug-related by the investigator (except for certain cardiovascular events that were recorded in a different category). Where the frequency of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The only dose-related effects were pedal edema and increased angina.

Adverse events in this category each occurred in <0.4% of patients receiving nicardipine hydrochloride capsules and included myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, exertional hypotension, pericarditis, heart block, cerebral ischemia, and ventricular tachycardia. It is possible that some of these events were drug-related. Hypertension The incidence rates of adverse effects in hypertensive patients were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials. Following are the rates of adverse effects for nicardipine hydrochloride capsules (n= 1390) and placebo (n= 211), respectively, that occurred in 0.4% of patients or more.

      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose (15 to 30 times normal clinical dose) has been reported. Marked hypotension (blood pressure unobtainable) and bradycardia (heart rate 20 bpm in normal sinus rhythm) occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulted in gradual improvement with normal vital signs approximately 9 hours posttreatment. Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, overdosage may cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia (following initial tachycardia) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block. Reversible hepatic function abnormalities and sporadic focal hepatic necrosis were noted in some animal species receiving very large doses of nicardipine. For treatment of overdose standard measures (for example, evacuation of gastric contents, elevation of extremities, attention to circulating fluid volume, and urine output) including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions should be implemented. The patient should be positioned so as to avoid cerebral anoxia. Frequent blood pressure determinations are essential. Vasopressors are clinically indicated for patients exhibiting profound hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Angina The dose should be individually titrated for each patient beginning with 20 mg three times daily. Doses in the range of 20 to 40 mg three times a day have been shown to be effective. At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antianginal Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during nicardipine hydrochloride capsules therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy : nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers : Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta- blockers (see Drug Interactions ) . Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations. Concomitant Use With Other Antihypertensive Agents Diuretics : nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safety co-administered with thiazide diuretics. Beta-blockers : nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta-blocker (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) Special Patient Population Renal Insufficiency Although there is no evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules impair renal function, careful dose titration beginning with 20 mg tid is advised (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Insufficiency Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. A suggested starting dose of 20 mg twice a day is advised with individual titration based on clinical findings maintaining the twice a day schedule (see PRECAUTIONS ). Congestive Heart Failure Caution is advised when titrating nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dosage in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS )."
