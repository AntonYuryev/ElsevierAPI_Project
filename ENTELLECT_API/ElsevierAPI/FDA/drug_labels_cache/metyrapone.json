[see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Assess ability of patient's adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH before Metopirone is employed as a test [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 Single-Dose Short Test- Recommended Dose and Interpretation This test, usually given on an outpatient basis, determines plasma 11-desoxycortisol and/or ACTH levels after a single dose of Metopirone. Patients with suspected adrenocortical insufficiency based on the test results previously performed should be hospitalized overnight as a precautionary measure ( see Warnings and Precaution (5.1) ). Recommended Dose In adult and pediatric patients, the recommended single dose is 30 mg/kg (maximum 3 grams of Metopirone) administered at midnight with milk/yogurt or snack. The blood sample for the assay is taken early the following morning (7:30-8:00 a.m.). After the blood sample is collected, a prophylactic dose of glucocorticoid may be considered for patients with high risk for acute adrenal insufficiency. Interpretation of 11\u2011desoxycortisol and ACTH Levels After Metopirone Administration Approximately 8 hours after administration of Metopirone, evaluate the values of ACTH and 11-desoxycortisol. Normal values will depend on the method used to determine ACTH and 11\u2011desoxycortisol levels. An intact HPA axis function is generally indicated by an increase in 11\u2011desoxycortisol to over 70 mcg/L. Because of an overlap between a normal ACTH response and an abnormal ACTH response, the ACTH response alone cannot be used to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with adrenal insufficiency."

Metyrapone crosses the placenta and may decrease fetal cortisol production (see Data ) . Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with metyrapone. Metyrapone can decrease reproductive hormones by targeting adrenal androgenesis. Data Human Data The Metopirone test was administered to pregnant women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy and evidence was found that the fetal pituitary responded to the enzymatic block. Transplacental transfer of Metopirone has been shown in humans and the drug can impair the biosynthesis of fetal and placental steroids. There are a few published reports of low cortisol levels at birth in infants exposed in utero following chronic use of metyrapone in pregnant females. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Metyrapone and its active metabolite, metyrapol, are present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of metyrapone on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Metopirone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Metopirone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metopirone is indicated, in combination with other diagnostic tests, for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in pediatric patients [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Metopirone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-beta-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17\u2011hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, Metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Metopirone exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The mean C max of metyrapone following a single 750 mg is 3.7 mcg/mL falling to 0.5 mcg/mL 4 hours after administration. Absorption The time to peak plasma concentration of metyrapone is approximately 1 hour after oral administration. Elimination The mean (\u00b1 SD) terminal elimination half\u2011lives of metyrapone and its active metabolite metyrapol are 1.9 (\u00b1 0.7) hours and approximately 4 hours, respectively. Metabolism Metyrapone is reduced to metyrapol, an active alcohol metabolite. Both metyrapone and metyrapol are conjugated with glucuronide. Eight hours after a single oral dose, the ratio of metyrapone to its active metabolite metyrapol in plasma is 1:1.5. Excretion Following administration of metyrapone 750 mg every 4 hours, approximately 5.3% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged and 38.5% as its active metabolite metyrapol within 72 hours after the first dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published case series and reports on Metopirone use in pregnant females are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Metyrapone crosses the placenta and may decrease fetal cortisol production (see Data ) . Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with metyrapone. Metyrapone can decrease reproductive hormones by targeting adrenal androgenesis. Data Human Data The Metopirone test was administered to pregnant women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy and evidence was found that the fetal pituitary responded to the enzymatic block. Transplacental transfer of Metopirone has been shown in humans and the drug can impair the biosynthesis of fetal and placental steroids. There are a few published reports of low cortisol levels at birth in infants exposed in utero following chronic use of metyrapone in pregnant females. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Metyrapone and its active metabolite, metyrapol, are present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of metyrapone on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Metopirone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Metopirone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metopirone is indicated, in combination with other diagnostic tests, for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in pediatric patients [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Metopirone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with cirrhosis may have an impaired response to Metopirone."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Death occurred in a child after two doses of Metopirone 2 g. Signs and Symptoms of Overdosage The clinical picture of overdosage with Metopirone is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and by signs of acute adrenal insufficiency. Cardiovascular System : Cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, dehydration. Nervous System and Muscles : Anxiety, confusion, weakness, impairment of consciousness. Gastrointestinal System: Nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, diarrhea. Laboratory Findings: Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia. In patients under treatment with insulin or oral antidiabetics, the signs and symptoms of acute overdosage with Metopirone may be aggravated or modified. Treatment and Management of Overdosage There is no specific antidote for Metopirone overdosage. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Metopirone overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal may be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. In addition to general measures, hydrocortisone should be administered at once, together with IV saline and glucose. This should be repeated as necessary in accordance with the patient's clinical condition. For a few days blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance should be monitored. Consult with a regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for additional treatment recommendations."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-beta-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17\u2011hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, Metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Metopirone exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The mean C max of metyrapone following a single 750 mg is 3.7 mcg/mL falling to 0.5 mcg/mL 4 hours after administration. Absorption The time to peak plasma concentration of metyrapone is approximately 1 hour after oral administration. Elimination The mean (\u00b1 SD) terminal elimination half\u2011lives of metyrapone and its active metabolite metyrapol are 1.9 (\u00b1 0.7) hours and approximately 4 hours, respectively. Metabolism Metyrapone is reduced to metyrapol, an active alcohol metabolite. Both metyrapone and metyrapol are conjugated with glucuronide. Eight hours after a single oral dose, the ratio of metyrapone to its active metabolite metyrapol in plasma is 1:1.5. Excretion Following administration of metyrapone 750 mg every 4 hours, approximately 5.3% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged and 38.5% as its active metabolite metyrapol within 72 hours after the first dose."
