Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine tablets treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine tablets or during clozapine tablets treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6 ) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. (1.1) Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior. (1.2) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ] . The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT TM trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ). Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg once or twice weekly ( 2.2 ). Maximum dosage is 450 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ). Administer with or without food (2.2) . See the dosage modifications based on ANC results and recommended frequency of ANC testing in the full prescribing information ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). See recommendations for discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment (2.5) , restarting clozapine tablets after interrupting dosing (2.6) , dosage modifications for drug interactions (2.7) , dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (2.8) in the full prescribing information. 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine Tablets Initiation Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting oral dosage of clozapine tablets is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended clozapine tablets oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended clozapine tablets dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Table 2. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine Tablets Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL) No dosage modification; continue treatment Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If clozapine tablets treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 2 Recommend hematology consultation No dosage modification; continue treatment Three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks If ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u03bcL) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 500/\u03bcL, obtain ANC three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours. 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets Treatment If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with: Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL. If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing clozapine tablets, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine Tablets Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine Tablets When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have interrupted clozapine Tablets treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. If two days of dosing is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. For longer interruptions, restart clozapine tablets treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial clozapine tablets treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of clozapine tablets-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Table 3. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the clozapine tablets dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe neutropenia: See Boxed Warning (5.1) Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.7 ) Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.8 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.9 ) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (5.10) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.10) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. (5.10) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. (5.11) Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur (5.12) . Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. (5.13) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. (5.14) Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. (5.16) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine tablets has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine tablets-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of clozapine tablets treatment. The mechanism by which clozapine tablets causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine tablets treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout clozapine tablets treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during clozapine tablets treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to clozapine tablets initiation. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in clozapine tablets-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during clozapine tablets treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Management of Clozapine Tablets-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during clozapine tablets treatment: Interrupt clozapine tablets in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 \u00b0F (38.5 \u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. If the ANC is less than 1000/\u03bcL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine Tablets in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with clozapine tablets in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their clozapine tablets-related severe neutropenia after stopping clozapine tablets, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting clozapine tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting clozapine tablets (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than clozapine tablets). Concomitant Use of clozapine tablets with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If clozapine tablets are used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine tablets mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets are identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group ( Table 4 ). The clozapine doses were 100 mg to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group ( Table 5 ). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6 . The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10)] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets are necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9.

These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10.

Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u226510% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2. 7 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.15 )] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure (8.1). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m2 body surface area (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/ m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine tablets 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N-oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N- oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N-desmethyl clozapine and clozapine N-oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N-desmethyl clozapine and clozapine N-oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u2264 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u2264 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine versus olanzapine ( * Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 mg to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 mg to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Cumulative Probability of a Significant Suicide Attempt or Hospitalization to Prevent Suicide in Patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder at High Risk of Suicidality Figure 1.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]: - About the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection with clozapine tablets treatment. - Instruct patients to immediately report to their health care provider any symptom or sign of during clozapine tablets treatment. - About the importance of having frequent ANC testing. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 ) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine tablets treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for 1 day or more, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy: Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with clozapine tablets. Advise patients that clozapine may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to clozapine tablets during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Lactation: Advise breastfeeding women using clozapine tablets to monitor infants for excess sedation and to seek medical care if they notice this sign. Inform breastfeeding women using clozapine tablets that their healthcare provider will monitor infants for neutropenia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]. Concomitant Medication: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1)) ] . *Zyprexa \u00ae (olanzapine) is a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company. **Trademark of Thomson Healthcare, Inc.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Clozapine (KLOH-zuh-peen) tablets, for oral use This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 07/2025 What is the most important information I should know about clozapine tablets? Clozapine tablets can cause serious side effects including: Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell (WBC) counts) that can lead to serious infections and death. Your healthcare provider will do WBC blood tests before starting treatment with clozapine tablets and weekly for the first 6 months. After your first 6 months of treatment, your healthcare provider will determine how frequent you will have blood tests. If you have symptoms of severe neutropenia or an infection, your healthcare provider will do more frequent WBC blood test(s) to check if clozapine tablets are causing your symptoms and may send you to see a blood specialist (hematologist). Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms or signs of neutropenia or infection: feel like you have the flu fever or chills feel extremely tired or weak sores or ulcers inside your mouth, gums, or on your skin sores or pain in or around your rectal area wounds that take a long time to heal skin, throat, vaginal, urinary tract, or lung infection pain or burning while peeing unusual vaginal discharge or itching abdominal pain or bloating Orthostatic hypotension (decreased blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), or syncope (fainting) that can lead to death. You may feel lightheaded or faint when you rise too quickly from a sitting or lying position. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you feel dizzy or pass out. Seizures. See \"What should I avoid while taking clozapine tablets?\" Myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation), pericarditis (inflammation of outer layer of the heart) and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) that can lead to death. Symptoms of myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy include: chest pain fast heartbeat or palpitations shortness of breath fever flu-like symptoms feel tired or faint swollen legs, ankles, or feet Increased risk of death in elderly people with dementia-related psychosis. Medicines like clozapine tablets can increase the risk of death in elderly people who have lost touch with reality (psychosis) due to confusion and dementia. Clozapine tablets is not for treatment of elderly people with dementia-related psychosis. What is clozapine tablets? Clozapine tablets are a prescription antipsychotic medicine used to treat people: Who are severely ill with schizophrenia not helped by other schizophrenia medicines With schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have been suicidal and may be at risk of suicidal behavior again It is not known if clozapine tablets are safe and effective in children.

Symptoms of clozapine tablets overdose can include: feeling sleepy confusion coma fast or irregular heartbeat low blood pressure shallow or difficult breathing having a lot of saliva in your mouth seizures What should I avoid while taking clozapine tablets? You should not drink alcohol while taking clozapine tablets because it can increase your chances of getting serious side effects. Do not drive, operate machinery, swim, climb, or do dangerous activities until you know how clozapine tablets affects you. What are the possible side effects of clozapine tablets? Clozapine tablets can cause serious side effects, including: See \"What is the most important information I should know about clozapine tablets?\" falls. Clozapine tablets may make you sleepy, dizzy, may cause a decrease in your blood pressure when changing positions, and can slow your thinking and motor skills which may lead to falls that can cause fractures or other injuries. slow emptying of your stomach and intestines (decreased gastric motility). Severe constipation and bowel problems can happen and can lead to hospitalization, surgery, and death. You may not feel or be aware of constipation symptoms. Your healthcare provider will examine you for possible bowel problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you get any signs and symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility during treatment with clozapine tablets, including: having bowel movements less than normal hard or dry stools difficulty passing gas stomach bloating or pain nausea or vomiting Staying well hydrated, increasing physical activity, and taking fiber during treatment with clozapine tablets can help prevent constipation and other bowel problems. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicines to prevent severe problems. high count of a certain white blood cell (eosinophilia). Clozapine tablets can cause a high count of eosinophils in some people and can be serious. This is a different risk than the risk of clozapine tablets causing an abnormally low white blood cell count (neutropenia). Your health care provider may send you to see an internal medicine specialist (internist) or blood specialist (hematologist). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: feeling very tired or weak fever rash swelling joint pain coughing and wheezing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea night sweats confusion difficulty swallowing serious heart rhythm problems (QTc Interval Prolongation) that can cause death.

Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine or during clozapine treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day , or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk . Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine . Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. C lozapine is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 5.2 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.5 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine is not approved for this condition. ( 5.6 )"

The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ). Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg once or twice weekly ( 2.2 ). Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ). Administer with or without food ( 2.2 ). See the dosage modifications based on ANC results and recommended frequency of ANC testing in the full prescribing information ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). See recommendations for discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment (2.5), restarting clozapine tablets after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions (2.7), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine Tablets Initiation Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended starting oral dosage of clozapine tablets is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended clozapine tablets oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended clozapine tablets dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].

For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Table 2. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours. Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine Tablets Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL ) No dosage modification; continue treatment Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If clozapine tablets treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 2 Recommend hematology consultation No dosage modification; continue treatment Three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks If ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u03bcL) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 500/\u03bcL, obtain ANC three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets Treatment If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with: Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL. If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing clozapine tablets, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine Tablets Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine Tablets When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have interrupted clozapine tablets treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. If two days of dosing is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. For longer interruptions, restart clozapine tablets treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial clozapine tablets treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of clozapine tablets-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Table 3. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the clozapine tablets dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe neutropenia: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.7 ) Eosinophilia : Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.8 ) QT Interval Prolongation : Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.9 ) Metabolic Changes : Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. ( 5.10 ) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( 5.10 ) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. ( 5.10 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) : Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.11 ) Hepatotoxicity : Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.12 ). Fever : Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.13 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.14 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity : When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout clozapine treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during clozapine treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to clozapine initiation. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in clozapine-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during clozapine treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Management of Clozapine-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during clozapine treatment: Interrupt clozapine in those who develop a temperature of 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. If the ANC is less than 1000/\u03bcL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with clozapine in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their clozapine-related severe neutropenia after stopping clozapine, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting clozapine (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than clozapine). Concomitant Use of Clozapine with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If clozapine is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy, and Mitral Valve Incompetence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Eosinophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Anticholinergic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) were: CNS reactions (sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor); cardiovascular reactions (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope); autonomic nervous system reactions (hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances); gastrointestinal reactions (constipation and nausea); and fever. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9.

These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u22652%) Reported in Clozapine-treated Patients (N=842) Across all Clozapine Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT TM Study) Body System Adverse Reaction* Clozapine N=842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 \u2020 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 \u2020 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary Abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry Mouth 6 Visual Disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 \u2020 Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine. Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT TM Study (\u226510% in the Clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect : Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine versus olanzapine (*Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

Cumulative Probability of a Significant Suicide Attempt or Hospitalization to Prevent Suicide in Patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder at High Risk of Suicidality Figure 1.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]: - About the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection with clozapine tablets treatment. - Instruct patients to immediately report to their health care provider any symptom or sign of during clozapine tablets treatment. - About the importance of having frequent ANC testing. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope : Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [ Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain) : Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for 1 day or more, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with clozapine. Advise patients that clozapine tablets may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to clozapine tablets during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Lactation: Advise breastfeeding women using clozapine to monitor infants for excess sedation and to seek medical care if they notice this sign. Inform breastfeeding women using clozapine that their healthcare provider will monitor infants for neutropenia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ]. Concomitant Medication: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .

Clozapine tablets can cause serious side effects including: Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell (WBC) counts) that can lead to serious infections and death . Your healthcare provider will do WBC blood tests before starting treatment with clozapine tablets and weekly for the first 6 months. After your first 6 months of treatment, your healthcare provider will determine how frequent you will have blood tests. If you have symptoms of severe neutropenia or an infection, your healthcare provider will do more frequent WBC blood test(s) to check if clozapine tablets are causing your symptoms and may send you to see a blood specialist (hematologist). Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms or signs of neutropenia or infection: feel like you have the flu wounds that take a long time to heal fever or chills skin, throat, vaginal, urinary tract, or lung infection feel extremely tired or weak pain or burning while peeing sores or ulcers inside your mouth, gums, or on your skin unusual vaginal discharge or itching sores or pain in or around your rectal area abdominal pain or bloating Orthostatic hypotension (decreased blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), or syncope (fainting) that can lead to death .

If you take too much (overdose) clozapine, call your healthcare provider or the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. Symptoms of clozapine tablets overdose can include: feeling sleepy fast or irregular heartbeat having a lot of saliva in your mouth confusion low blood pressure seizures coma shallow or difficult breathing What should I avoid while taking clozapine tablets? You should not drink alcohol while taking clozapine tablets because it can increase your chances of getting serious side effects. Do not drive, operate machinery, swim, climb, or do dangerous activities until you know how clozapine tablets affect you. What are the possible side effects of clozapine tablets? Clozapine tablets can cause serious side effects, including: See \"What is the most important information I should know about clozapine tablets?\" falls. Clozapine tablets may make you sleepy, dizzy, may cause a decrease in your blood pressure when changing positions, and can slow your thinking and motor skills which may lead to falls that can cause fractures or other injuries. slow emptying of your stomach and intestines (decreased gastric motility). Severe constipation and bowel problems can happen and can lead to hospitalization, surgery, and death. You may not feel or be aware of constipation symptoms. Your healthcare provider will examine you for possible bowel problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you get any signs and symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility during treatment with clozapine tablets, including: having bowel movements less than normal stomach bloating or pain hard or dry stools nausea or vomiting difficulty passing gas Staying well hydrated, increasing physical activity, and taking fiber during treatment with clozapine tablets can help prevent constipation and other bowel problems. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicines to prevent severe problems. high count of a certain white blood cell (eosinophilia). Clozapine tablets can cause a high count of eosinophils in some people and can be serious. This is a different risk than the risk of clozapine tablets causing an abnormally low white blood cell count (neutropenia).

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) has caused severe neutropenia which is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L (less than 1000/\u00b5L for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 )]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT or during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine ODT is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L (less than 1000/\u00b5L for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 5.4 ) Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.5 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine ODT is not approved for this condition. ( 5.6 )"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets (Clozapine ODT) is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment ( 1.1 ) Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with their use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 )]. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozapine ODT and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine ODT is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day at target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ) Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Administer with or without food. Clozapine ODT may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water. See additional administration instructions in full prescribing information ( 2.2 ). See dosage modification based on ANC results ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) See recommendations for discontinuing Clozapine ODT treatment ( 2.5 ), restarting Clozapine ODT after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions ( 2.7 ), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. Tablets rapidly disintegrate after placement in the mouth and may be chewed if desired. No water is needed ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine ODT Initiation Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ). 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration Recommended Dosage To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . The recommended starting oral dosage of Clozapine ODT is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended Clozapine ODT oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. Administration Instructions Clozapine ODT can be taken with or without food, may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Just prior to use, peel the foil from the blister and gently remove the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT). Do not push the ODT through the foil, because this could damage the ODT. After removing Clozapine ODT from the blister pack or bottle, immediately place in the mouth. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended Clozapine ODT dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )].

If ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L after monitoring weekly for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal Range ANC testing frequency Severe Neutropenia (ANC less than 500/\u00b5L) 1 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients who initiate treatment 1 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours 2.4 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results for Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Table 2 provides recommended Clozapine ODT dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count). [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Table 2: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine ODT Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u00b5L ) No dosage modification; continue treatment Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If Clozapine ODT treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u00b5L) 2 Recommend hematology consultation No dosage modification; continue treatment Three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks If ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN. Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u00b5L) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 500/\u00b5L, obtain ANC three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT Treatment If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with: Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u00b5L. If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing Clozapine ODT, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine ODT Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine ODT When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have interrupted Clozapine ODT treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. If two days of dosing is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. For longer interruptions, restart Clozapine ODT treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial Clozapine ODT treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of Clozapine ODT-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Table 3: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the Clozapine ODT dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the Clozapine ODT dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe neutropenia: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.7 ) Eosinophilia : Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.8 ) QT Interval Prolongation : Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.9 ) Metabolic Changes : Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include ( 5.10 ): Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) : Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.11 ) Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.12 ). Fever : Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.14 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occurs. ( 5.15 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity : When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u00b5L) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of Clozapine ODT treatment. The mechanism by which Clozapine ODT causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose-dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L. Throughout VERSACLOZ treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during Clozapine ODT treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing Clozapine ODT-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to Clozapine ODT initiation. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in Clozapine ODT-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during Clozapine ODT treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Management of Clozapine ODT-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during Clozapine ODT treatment: Interrupt Clozapine ODT in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 \u00b0F (38.5 \u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. If the ANC is less than 1000/\u00b5L in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) for fever. Restarting Clozapine ODT in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with Clozapine ODT in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their Clozapine ODT-related severe neutropenia after stopping Clozapine ODT, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting Clozapine ODT treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting Clozapine ODT (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than Clozapine ODT). Concomitant Use of Clozapine ODT with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If Clozapine ODT is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Tables 1 and 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Clozapine ODT treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum Clozapine ODT dosage is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine ODT may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate Clozapine ODT treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with Clozapine ODT use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. However, if the benefit of Clozapine ODT treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with Clozapine ODT in consultation with a cardiologist. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving Clozapine ODT who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with Clozapine ODT. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine ODT is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in Clozapine ODT-treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during Clozapine ODT treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue Clozapine ODT immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to Clozapine ODT is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue Clozapine ODT. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of Clozapine ODT, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Clozapine ODT under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt Clozapine ODT therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing Clozapine ODT, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue Clozapine ODT if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue Clozapine ODT. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on Clozapine ODT should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Normal (<100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) to Fasting Glucose High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using Clozapine ODT, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with Clozapine ODT. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to Clozapine ODT. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine ODT has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with Clozapine ODT can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine ODT can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Clozapine ODT does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe Clozapine ODT in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with Clozapine ODT despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that Clozapine ODT contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.4 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.8 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 16.8 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 22.4 mg phenylalanine. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for Clozapine ODT or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine ODT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT If abrupt discontinuation of Clozapine ODT is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9: Common Adverse Reactions (\u22655%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-Controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine Chlorpromazine Adverse Reaction (N=126) (N=142) (%) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine studies (excluding the 2 year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure.

Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u226510% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Clozapine Olanzapine N=479 N=477 Adverse Reactions % Reporting % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce Clozapine ODT dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). (2.7, 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. (2.7, 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing Clozapine ODT dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. (2.7, 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. (5.7, 5.15, 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine ODT Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine ODT dose to one third of the original dose when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Clozapine ODT dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozapine ODT. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.15 )] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine ODT to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering Clozapine ODT with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Clozapine ODT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Clozapine ODT or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clozapine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with Clozapine ODT treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of Clozapine ODT, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )]. Carefully select Clozapine ODT doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )]. 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Clozapine ODT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Clozapine ODT or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with Clozapine ODT treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of Clozapine ODT, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )]. Carefully select Clozapine ODT doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )]."

There are reports of aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizure. Fatal overdoses have been reported with clozapine, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 g. 10.2 Management of Overdosage There are no specific antidotes for Clozapine ODT overdose. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac status and vital signs. Use general symptomatic and supportive measures. Consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of overdosage (1-800-222-1222)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of Clozapine ODT in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans Clozapine ODT (25 mg and 100 mg) is equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine oral solution. Clozapine ODT is bioequivalent to Clozaril \u00ae (clozapine) tablets, a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Following a dosage of 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 413 ng/mL (range: 132 to 854 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.3 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 168 ng/mL (range: 45 to 574 ng/mL), after 100 mg b.i.d. dosing. A comparative bioequivalence/bioavailability study was conducted in 32 patients (with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) comparing Clozapine ODT 200 mg to 2 \u00d7 Clozapine ODT 100 mg (the approved reference product) under fasted conditions. The study also evaluated the effect of food and chewing on the pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg tablet. Under fasted conditions, the mean AUC ss and C min,ss of clozapine for the 200 mg oral disintegrating tablets were equivalent to those of the 2 x 100 mg tablets. The mean C max,ss of clozapine for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was 85% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT. This decrease in C max,ss for Clozapine ODT 200 mg is not clinically significant. For Clozapine ODT 200 mg, food significantly increased the C min,ss of clozapine by 21%. However, this increase is not clinically significant. The mean AUC ss and C max,ss of clozapine under fed conditions were equivalent to those under fasted conditions. Food delayed clozapine absorption by 1.5 hours, from a median T max of 2.5 hours under fasted conditions to 4 hours under fed conditions. The mean C max,ss of clozapine under chewed conditions for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was about 86% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT under non-chewed conditions, while the AUC ss and C min,ss values were similar between the chewed and non-chewed conditions. In a food-effect study, a single dose of Clozapine ODT 12.5 mg was administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal. When Clozapine ODT were administered after a high-fat meal, the C max of both clozapine and its active metabolite, desmethylclozapine, were decreased by approximately 20%, compared to administration under fasting conditions, while the AUC values were unchanged. This decrease in C max is not clinically significant. Therefore, Clozapine ODT can be taken without regard to meals. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of Clozapine ODT demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine: A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline: In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers: A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and Other Inflammatory Conditions: Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of six weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT \u2122 , a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine (Clozaril \u00ae ) versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met one of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during Clozapine ODT treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking Clozapine ODT [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention, and treatment of Clozapine ODT-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine or during clozapine treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . \u2022 Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ]. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg once or twice weekly ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Administer with or without food ( 2.2 ). \u2022 See the dosage modifications based on ANC results and recommended frequency of ANC testing in the full prescribing information ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). \u2022 See recommendations for discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment (2.5), restarting clozapine tablets after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions (2.7), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine Tablets Initiation Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended starting oral dosage of clozapine tablets is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended clozapine tablets oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended clozapine tablets dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].

For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Table 2. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours. Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine Tablets Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL ) No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly \u2022 Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks \u2022 Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If clozapine tablets treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: \u2022 < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2022 \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 2 \u2022 Recommend hematology consultation \u2022 No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks \u2022 If ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u03bcL) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation \u2022 Daily \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 500/\u03bcL, obtain ANC three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets Treatment If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with: \u2022 Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. \u2022 Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL. If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: \u2022 Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. \u2022 ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing clozapine tablets, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine Tablets Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine Tablets When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have interrupted clozapine tablets treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. \u2022 If two days of dosing is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. \u2022 For longer interruptions, restart clozapine tablets treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial clozapine tablets treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of clozapine tablets-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Table 3. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the clozapine tablets dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

( 5.13 ) \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.14 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Toxicity : When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout clozapine treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during clozapine treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to clozapine initiation. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in clozapine-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during clozapine treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Management of Clozapine-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during clozapine treatment: \u2022 Interrupt clozapine in those who develop a temperature of 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. \u2022 If the ANC is less than 1000/\u03bcL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with clozapine in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their clozapine-related severe neutropenia after stopping clozapine, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting clozapine (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than clozapine). Concomitant Use of Clozapine with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If clozapine is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy, and Mitral Valve Incompetence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Eosinophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] \u2022 Fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] \u2022 Anticholinergic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] \u2022 Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] \u2022 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) were: CNS reactions (sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor); cardiovascular reactions (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope); autonomic nervous system reactions (hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances); gastrointestinal reactions (constipation and nausea); and fever. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9.

These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u22652%) Reported in Clozapine-treated Patients (N=842) Across all Clozapine Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT TM Study) Body System Adverse Reaction* Clozapine N=842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 \u2020 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 \u2020 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary Abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry Mouth 6 Visual Disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 \u2020 Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine. Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT TM Study (\u226510% in the Clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine versus olanzapine (*Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: \u2022 They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

Cumulative Probability of a Significant Suicide Attempt or Hospitalization to Prevent Suicide in Patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder at High Risk of Suicidality Figure 1.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: \u2022 Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]: - About the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection with clozapine tablets treatment. - Instruct patients to immediately report to their health care provider any symptom or sign of during clozapine tablets treatment. - About the importance of having frequent ANC testing. \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope : Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [ Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain) : Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . \u2022 Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for 1 day or more, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]. \u2022 Pregnancy: Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with clozapine. Advise patients that clozapine tablets may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Clozapine ( kloe\u2032 za peen ) Tablets, USP for oral use What is the most important information I should know about clozapine tablets? Clozapine tablets can cause serious side effects including: \u2022 Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell (WBC) counts) that can lead to serious infections and death . Your healthcare provider will do WBC blood tests before starting treatment with clozapine tablets and weekly for the first 6 months. After your first 6 months of treatment, your healthcare provider will determine how frequent you will have blood tests. If you have symptoms of severe neutropenia or an infection, your healthcare provider will do more frequent WBC blood test(s) to check if clozapine tablets are causing your symptoms and may send you to see a blood specialist (hematologist). Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms or signs of neutropenia or infection: o feel like you have the flu o wounds that take a long time to heal o fever or chills o skin, throat, vaginal, urinary tract, or lung infection o feel extremely tired or weak o pain or burning while peeing o sores or ulcers inside your mouth, gums, or on your skin o unusual vaginal discharge or itching o sores or pain in or around your rectal area o abdominal pain or bloating \u2022 Orthostatic hypotension (decreased blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), or syncope (fainting) that can lead to death . You may feel lightheaded or faint when you rise too quickly from a sitting or lying position. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you feel dizzy or pass out. \u2022 Seizures.

Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine tablets treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine tablets or during clozapine tablets treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is dose - related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine tablets-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine tablets are not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. \u2022 Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine tablets have caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine tablets treatment ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ] . The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg once or twice weekly ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Administer with or without food ( 2.2 ). \u2022 See the dosage modifications based on ANC results and recommended frequency of ANC testing in the full prescribing information ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). \u2022 See recommendations for discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment ( 2.5 ), restarting clozapine tablets after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions ( 2.7 ), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine Tablets Initiation Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended starting oral dosage of clozapine tablets is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended clozapine tablets oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended clozapine tablets dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] .

If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: \u2022 Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . \u2022 ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing clozapine tablets, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine Tablets Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine Tablets When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have interrupted clozapine tablets treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. \u2022 If two days of dosing is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. \u2022 For longer interruptions, restart clozapine tablets treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial clozapine tablets treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of clozapine tablets-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 3. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the clozapine tablets dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ]."

( 5.9 ) \u2022 Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: o Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. ( 5.10 ) o Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( 5.10 ) o Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.12 ). \u2022 Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.14 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine tablets have caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine tablets-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of clozapine tablets treatment. The mechanism by which clozapine tablets cause neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine tablets treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout clozapine tablets treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during clozapine tablets treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to clozapine tablets initiation. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in clozapine tablets-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during clozapine tablets treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Management of Clozapine Tablets-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during clozapine tablets treatment: \u2022 Interrupt clozapine tablets in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 \u00b0F (38.5 \u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. \u2022 If the ANC is less than 1000/\u00b5L in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine Tablets in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with clozapine tablets in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their clozapine tablets-related severe neutropenia after stopping clozapine tablets, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting clozapine tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting clozapine tablets (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than clozapine tablets). Concomitant Use of Clozapine Tablets with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If clozapine tablets are used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine tablets. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine tablets mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets, primarily due to their potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Prior to initiating clozapine tablets, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine tablets-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QT c interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine tablets group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine tablets doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine Tablets 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine Tablets 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine tablets group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine tablets group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine tablets dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine tablets and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine tablets, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine tablets monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets have potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets do not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) across clozapine tablets clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in clozapine tablets-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9. Common Adverse Reactions (\u2265 5%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine Tablets (N = 126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N = 142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine tablets-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine tablets studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u2265 2%) Reported in Clozapine Tablets-treated Patients (N = 842) Across all Clozapine Tablets Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study) Body System Adverse Reaction Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine tablets. Clozapine Tablets N = 842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary Abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry Mouth 6 Visual Disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10% of the clozapine tablets or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine tablets relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine Tablets or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u2265 10% in the Clozapine Tablets or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine Tablets N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine tablets dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine tablets with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine tablets should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine tablets treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine tablets 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine tablets. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady-state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady-state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n = 14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%-10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N = 305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (N = 268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine tablets (N = 126) or chlorpromazine (N = 142). The maximum daily clozapine tablets dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u2264 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u2264 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine tablets group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine tablets group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p < 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine tablets versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: \u2022 They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200-900 mg/day for clozapine tablets and 5-20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine tablets or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18-69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine tablets had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine tablets in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine tablets over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine tablets patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine tablets 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, a baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine orally disintegrating tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine can cause severe neutropenia, which can lead to serious and fatal infections. Patients initiating and continuing treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must have a baseline blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured before treatment initiation and regular ANC monitoring during treatment ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS ( 5.2 ). Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 5.3 ). Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure ( 2.3 , 5.5 ). Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions ( 5.6 ). Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are not approved for this condition ( 5.7 )."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study ( 1.1 , 14.1 ). Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study ( 1.2 , 14.2 ). 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.5 )] . The effectiveness of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose: 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily ( 2.3 ). Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule ( 2.3 , 5.3 ). Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated ( 2.3 ). Target Dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks ( 2.3 ). Subsequent Increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly ( 2.3 ). Maximum Daily Dose: 900 mg ( 2.3 ). Tablets rapidly disintegrate after placement in the mouth and may be chewed if desired. No water is needed ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population, and at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 Important Administration Instructions Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be immediately placed in the mouth after removing the tablet from the blister pack or bottle. The tablet disintegrates rapidly after placement in the mouth. The tablets can be allowed to disintegrate, or they may be chewed. They may be swallowed with saliva. No water is necessary for administration. The orally disintegrating tablets in a blister pack should be left in the unopened blister until the time of use. Just prior to use, peel the foil from the blister and gently remove the orally disintegrating tablet. Do not push the tablets through the foil, because this could damage the tablet. 2.3 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ] . 2.4 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient\u2019s last ANC: See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is \u2265 1500/\u03bcL and for BEN patients until their ANC is \u2265 1000/\u03bcL or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5\u00b0C or 101.3\u00b0F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.6 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If one day\u2019s dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing has been missed, resume dosage at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate with a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.7 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant Use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 1: Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co-medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine orally disintegrating tablets while taking a co-medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose. Increase clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if the inducer is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Reduce clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Consider increasing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if necessary. 2.8 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised ( 5.8 ). Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur ( 5.9 ). QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) ( 5.10 ). Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes ( 5.11 ). Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics ( 5.11 ). Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain ( 5.11 ). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions ( 5.12 ). Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.13 ). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS ( 5.14 ). Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep vein thrombosis occurs ( 5.15 ). Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions ( 5.16 , 7.1 ). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles ( 5.17 ). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \u201csegs\u201d plus neutrophil \u201cbands\u201d). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, \u201csevere neutropenia\u201d replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/\u03bcL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine orally disintegrating tablets cause neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (\u2265) 1500/\u03bcL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient\u2019s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.

It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine orally disintegrating tablets management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline \u2265 1000/\u00b5L) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.5 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/\u00b5L) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or \u2265 patient\u2019s known baseline Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient\u2019s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient\u2019s last \u201cNormal BEN Range\u201d ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/\u00b5L) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC \u2265 500/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 patient\u2019s baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \u201cNormal Range\u201d monitoring once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient\u2019s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt clozapine orally disintegrating tablets as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17) . Rechallenge After an ANC Less Than 500/\u00b5L (Severe Neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine orally disintegrating tablets-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine orally disintegrating tablets). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. Patients who receive clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements. Pharmacies dispensing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Use clozapine orally disintegrating tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in consultation with a cardiologist. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine orally disintegrating tablets who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.8 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Prior to initiating clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.9 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine orally disintegrating tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.10 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. 5.11 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL, respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.13 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.14 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.15 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets have potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets do not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.19 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.90 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 7.59 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 11.38 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 15.18 mg phenylalanine. 5.20 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine orally disintegrating tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.21 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound After Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u2265 10% in the Clozapine or Olanzapine Group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System: Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System: Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System: Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System: Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders: Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System: Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, and renal failure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System: Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders: Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous: Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) ( 2.7 , 7.1 ). Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended ( 2.7 , 7.1 ). Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued ( 2.7 , 7.1 ). Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity ( 5.8 , 5.16 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.16) ] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or discontinue nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mother ( 8.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Clinical Considerations Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Clozapine is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Carefully select clozapine orally disintegrating tablets doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Hospice Patients For hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or less), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient\u2019s terminal illness."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Clinical Considerations Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets also act as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In man, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are bioequivalent to Clozaril \u00ae (clozapine) tablets, a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Following a dosage of 100 mg b.i.d., the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 413 ng/mL (range: 132-854 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.3 hours (range: 1-6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 168 ng/mL (range: 45-574 ng/mL), after 100 mg b.i.d. dosing. A comparative bioequivalence/bioavailability study was conducted in 32 patients (with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) comparing clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets to 2 \u00d7 clozapine orally disintegrating 100 mg tablets (the approved reference product) under fasted conditions. The study also evaluated the effect of food and chewing on the pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg tablet. Under fasted conditions, the mean AUC ss and C min,ss of clozapine for the 200 mg tablets were equivalent to those of the 2 x 100 mg tablets. The mean C max,ss of clozapine for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets was 85% that for 2 x 100 mg clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. This decrease in C max,ss for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets is not clinically significant. For clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets, food significantly increased the C min,ss of clozapine by 21%. However, this increase is not clinically significant. The mean AUC ss and C max,ss of clozapine under fed conditions were equivalent to those under fasted conditions. Food delayed clozapine absorption by 1.5 hours, from a median T max of 2.5 hours under fasted conditions to 4 hours under fed conditions. The mean C max,ss of clozapine under chewed conditions for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets was about 86% that for 2 x 100 mg clozapine orally disintegrating tablets under non-chewed conditions, while the AUC ss and C min,ss values were similar between the chewed and non-chewed conditions. In a food-effect study, a single dose of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets 12.5 mg was administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal. When clozapine orally disintegrating tablets were administered after a high-fat meal, the C max of both clozapine and its active metabolite, desmethylclozapine, were decreased by approximately 20%, compared to administration under fasting conditions, while the AUC values were unchanged. This decrease in C max is not clinically significant. Therefore, clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can be taken without regard to meals. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4-12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4-66 hours), after achieving steady-state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady-state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n = 14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%\u201310%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and Other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N = 305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n = 268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N = 126) or chlorpromazine (N = 142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u2264 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u2264 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of six weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p < 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine (Clozaril \u00ae ) versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met one of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200-900 mg/day for clozapine and 5-20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range: 18\u201369). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , (5.12) , and (5.14) ] . Inform patients and caregivers clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows: Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months. An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy. An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.6) ] . Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Falls: Inform patients of the risk of falls, which may lead to fractures or other injuries [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention, and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Weight Gain): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Patients with Phenylketonuria: Inform patients and caregivers that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine orally disintegrating tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . Hepatotoxicity: Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of potential liver injury (e.g., fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . Missed Doses and Re-Initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets for more than 2 days, he or she should not restart his or her medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ] . Pregnancy: Patients and caregivers should notify the clinician if the patient becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Nursing: Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should not breast feed an infant if she is taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Concomitant Medication: Advise patients to inform their health care provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Administration: Patients should be advised that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should remain in the original package until immediately before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] .

Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L (less than 1000/\u00b5L for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ] . Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT or during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 and 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine ODT is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] .

Prior to initiating Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment. ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets (Clozapine ODT) is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with their use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ]. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozapine ODT and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine ODT is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day at target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Subsequently may increase the doage in increments up to 100 mg, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Administer with or without food. Clozapine ODT may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water. See additional administration instructions in the full prescribing information. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 See dosage modification based on ANC results. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) \u2022 See recommendations for discontinuing Clozapine ODT treatment ( 2.5 ), restarting Clozapine ODT after interrupting dosing (2.6), dosage modifications for drug interactions ( 2.7 ), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. \u2022 Tablets rapidly disintegrate after placement in the mouth and may be chewed if desired. No water is needed. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine ODT Initiation Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration Recommended Dosage To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The recommended starting oral dosage of Clozapine ODT is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended Clozapine ODT oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. Administration Instructions Clozapine ODT can be taken with or without food, may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . After removing Clozapine ODT from the bottle, immediately place in the mouth. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended Clozapine ODT dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine ODT Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u00b5L ) No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly \u2022 Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks \u2022 Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If Clozapine ODT treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: \u2022 < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2022 \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u00b5L) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours \u2022 Recommend hematology consultation \u2022 No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks \u2022 If ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN. Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u00b5L) Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation \u2022 Daily \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 500/\u00b5L, obtain ANC three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT Treatment If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with: \u2022 Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . \u2022 Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u2265 1500/\u00b5L. If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: \u2022 Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . \u2022 ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing Clozapine ODT, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine ODT Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine ODT When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have interrupted Clozapine ODT treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. \u2022 If two days of dosing is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. \u2022 For longer interruptions, restart Clozapine ODT treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial Clozapine ODT treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of Clozapine ODT-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 3: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the Clozapine ODT dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the Clozapine ODT dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Severe neutropenia: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include ( 5.10 ): o Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. o Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. o Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. \u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur. ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep vein thrombosis occurs. ( 5.14 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u00b5L) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of Clozapine ODT treatment. The mechanism by which Clozapine ODT causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose-dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L. Throughout Clozapine ODT treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during Clozapine ODT treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing Clozapine ODT-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to Clozapine ODT initiation. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in Clozapine ODT-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during Clozapine ODT treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Management of Clozapine ODT-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during Clozapine ODT treatment: \u2022 Interrupt Clozapine ODT in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 \u00b0F (38.5 \u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. \u2022 If the ANC is less than 1000/\u00b5L in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine ODT in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with Clozapine ODT in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their Clozapine ODT-related severe neutropenia after stopping Clozapine ODT, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting Clozapine ODT treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting Clozapine ODT (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than Clozapine ODT). Concomitant Use of Clozapine ODT with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If Clozapine ODT is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Tables 1 and 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Clozapine ODT treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum Clozapine ODT dosage is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine ODT may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate Clozapine ODT treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with Clozapine ODT use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. However, if the benefit of Clozapine ODT treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with Clozapine ODT in consultation with a cardiologist. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving Clozapine ODT who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with Clozapine ODT. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine, mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine ODT is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in Clozapine ODT-treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during Clozapine ODT treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue Clozapine ODT immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to Clozapine ODT is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue Clozapine ODT. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of Clozapine ODT, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Clozapine ODT under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt Clozapine ODT therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing Clozapine ODT, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue Clozapine ODT if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue Clozapine ODT. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on Clozapine ODT should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL, respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using Clozapine ODT, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with Clozapine ODT. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to Clozapine ODT. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine ODT has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with Clozapine ODT can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine ODT can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Clozapine ODT does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe Clozapine ODT in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with Clozapine ODT despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that Clozapine ODT contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.90 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 7.59 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 11.38 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 15.18 mg phenylalanine. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for Clozapine ODT or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine ODT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT If abrupt discontinuation of Clozapine ODT is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9: Common Adverse Reactions (\u2265 5%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-Controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine (N = 126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N = 142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine studies (excluding the 2 year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10: Adverse Reactions (\u2265 2%) Reported in Clozapine-treated Patients (N = 842) Across all Clozapine Studies (excluding the 2 year InterSePT\u2122 Study) Body System Adverse Reaction Clozapine N = 842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 \u2020 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 \u2020 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry mouth 6 Visual disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 \u2020 Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine. Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u2265 10% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, and renal failure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce Clozapine ODT dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing Clozapine ODT dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine ODT Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine ODT dose to one-third of the original dose when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Clozapine ODT dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozapine ODT. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine ODT to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering Clozapine ODT with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactaton: Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations ) . There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Clozapine ODT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Clozapine ODT or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clozapine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with Clozapine ODT treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of Clozapine ODT, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select Clozapine ODT doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of Clozapine ODT in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, Clozapine ODT (25 mg and 100 mg) is equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine oral solution. Clozapine ODT is bioequivalent to Clozaril \u00ae (clozapine) tablets. Following a dosage of 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 413 ng/mL (range: 132 to 854 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.3 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 168 ng/mL (range: 45 to 574 ng/mL), after 100 mg b.i.d. dosing. A comparative bioequivalence/bioavailability study was conducted in 32 patients (with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) comparing Clozapine ODT 200 mg to 2 \u00d7 Clozapine ODT 100 mg (the approved reference product) under fasted conditions. The study also evaluated the effect of food and chewing on the pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg tablet. Under fasted conditions, the mean AUC ss and C min,ss of clozapine for the 200 mg oral disintegrating tablets were equivalent to those of the 2 x 100 mg tablets. The mean C max,ss of clozapine for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was 85% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT. This decrease in C max,ss for Clozapine ODT 200 mg is not clinically significant. For Clozapine ODT 200 mg, food significantly increased the C min,ss of clozapine by 21%. However, this increase is not clinically significant. The mean AUC ss and C max,ss of clozapine under fed conditions were equivalent to those under fasted conditions. Food delayed clozapine absorption by 1.5 hours, from a median T max of 2.5 hours under fasted conditions to 4 hours under fed conditions. The mean C max,ss of clozapine under chewed conditions for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was about 86% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT under non-chewed conditions, while the AUC ss and C min,ss values were similar between the chewed and non-chewed conditions. In a food-effect study, a single dose of Clozapine ODT 12.5 mg was administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal. When Clozapine ODT was administered after a high-fat meal, the C max of both clozapine and its active metabolite, desmethylclozapine, were decreased by approximately 20%, compared to administration under fasting conditions, while the AUC values were unchanged. This decrease in C max is not clinically significant. Therefore, Clozapine ODT can be taken without regard to meals. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady-state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of Clozapine ODT demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady-state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine: A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline: In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n = 14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers: A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and Other Inflammatory Conditions: Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of Clozapine ODT in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N = 305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n = 268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N = 126) or chlorpromazine (N = 142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u2264 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u2264 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of six weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p < 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine (Clozaril \u00ae ) versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met one of the following criteria: \u2022 They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range: 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

      "Medication Guide Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT), for oral use (kloe\u2032 za peen) What is the most important information I should know about CLOZAPINE ODT? CLOZAPINE ODT can cause serious side effects including: \u2022 Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell (WBC) counts) that can lead to serious infections and death. Your healthcare provider will do WBC blood tests before starting treatment with Clozapine ODT and weekly for the first 6 months. After your first 6 months of treatment, your healthcare provider will determine how frequent you will have blood tests.

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine tablets treatment has caused severe neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500 / \u03bcL. Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets a baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) ] . Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine tablets-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine tablets are not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine tablets can cause severe neutropenia, which can lead to serious and fatal infections. Patients initiating and continuing treatment with clozapine tablets must have a baseline blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured before treatment initiation and regular ANC monitoring during treatment. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS. ( 5.2 ) Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.5 , 5.3 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.6 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine tablets are not approved for this condition. ( 5.7 )"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.1 , 14.1 ) Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.2 , 14.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.5 )] . The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose: 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated. ( 2.2 ) Target dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Subsequent increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dose: 900 mg. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u00b5L for the general population, and at least 1000/\u00b5L for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient\u2019s last ANC: See Table 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine tablets therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL and for BEN patients until their ANC is \u22651000/\u03bcL or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5\u00b0C or 101.3\u00b0F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If one day\u2019s dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing have been missed, resume dose at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate at a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well-tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) ( Table 1 ) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Table 1. Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co-medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine tablets while taking a co-medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine tablets dose. Increase clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine tablets dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.8 ) Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.9 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.10 ) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. ( 5.11 ) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( 5.11 ) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. ( 5.11 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.12 ) Hepatotoxicity : Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.13 ). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.14 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.15 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.16 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.17 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \u201csegs\u201d plus neutrophil \u201cbands\u201d) . Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Table 2 and 3 ). To improve and standardize understanding, \u201csevere neutropenia\u201d replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/\u03bcL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine tablets and are associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine tablets cause neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2 ) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (\u2265) 1500/\u03bcL are considered within normal range ( Table 2 ) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient\u2019s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (\u22651500/\u03bcL) Initiate treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/\u03bcL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L, return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/\u03bcL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia Resume treatment once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L Daily until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/\u03bcL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Clozapine Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3 ) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than \u201cstandard\u201d laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine tablets treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine tablets management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine tablets treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline \u2265 1000/\u03bcL) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/\u03bcL Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or \u2265 patient's known baseline Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, or at patient's known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal BEN Range\" ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/\u03bcL Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC \u2265 500/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 patient's baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient's baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt clozapine tablets as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Table 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17 ). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/\u03bcL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine tablets-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine tablets). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Table 2 and 3 , the patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine tablets rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine Tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine tablets treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine tablets are used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Table 2 and 3 . Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablets Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine tablets who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine tablets. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine tablets mitral valve incompetence has been reported. These cases reported either mild or moderate mitral regurgitation on two-dimensional echocardiography. In patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, consider a 2D-echo Doppler examination to identify mitral valve incompetence. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.8 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.2 )] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Prior to initiating clozapine tablets, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.9 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine tablets-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.10 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.11 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine tablets group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group ( Table 4 ). The clozapine tablets doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine tablets group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine tablets group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group ( Table 5 ). In addition, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6 . The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine tablets dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine tablets monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.13 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.14 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . 5.15 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

( 6.1 )To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-406-7984 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine tablets clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine tablets-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9. Common Adverse Reactions (\u2265 5%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine Tablets (N = 126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N = 142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine tablets-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine tablets studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10.

Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine tablets or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine tablets relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine Tablets or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u226510% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine Tablets N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine tablets dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.8 , 5.16 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine tablets with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8, 5.16 )]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or discontinue nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, clozapine tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Clinical Considerations Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data In embryo fetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Clozapine tablets is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clozapine tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine tablets treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine tablets, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . Carefully select clozapine tablets doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Hospice Patients For hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient\u2019s terminal illness."

There are reports of aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizure. Fatal overdoses have been reported with clozapine, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 g. 10.2 Management of Overdosage There is no available specific antidote to an overdose of clozapine tablets. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac status and vital signs. Use general symptomatic and supportive measures. Consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of overdosage (1-800- 222-1222)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine tablets also act as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine tablets 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine tablets. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%\u201310%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine tablets (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine tablets dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of < 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of < 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine tablets group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine tablets group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p< 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine tablets versus olanzapine ( * Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200\u2013 900 mg/day for clozapine tablets and 5\u201320 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine tablets or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18\u201369). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine tablets had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine tablets in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine tablets over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine tablets patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine tablets 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% ( Figure 1 ).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine tablets about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine tablets therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), 5.11 , 5.14 )] . Inform patients and caregivers clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows: Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months. An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy, An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy. Clozapine tablets are available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product ( www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope : Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [ see Dosage and Administraton ( 2.2, 2.5 ) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Seizures : Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine tablets treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . QT Interval Prolongation : Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain ): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] . Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment : Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for more than 2 days, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 )] . Pregnancy : Patients and caregivers should notify the clinician if the patient becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Nursing : Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should not breastfeed an infant if they are taking clozapine tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Concomitant Medication : Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia which is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine or during clozapine treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . \u2022 Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during clozapine treatment ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ]. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg once or twice weekly ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Administer with or without food ( 2.2 ). \u2022 See the dosage modifications based on ANC results and recommended frequency of ANC testing in the full prescribing information ( 2.3 , 2.4 ). \u2022 See recommendations for discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment (2.5), restarting clozapine tablets after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions (2.7), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine Tablets Initiation Prior to initiating clozapine tablets treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine tablets initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended starting oral dosage of clozapine tablets is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended clozapine tablets oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended clozapine tablets dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ].

For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Table 2. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours. Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine Tablets Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL ) No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly \u2022 Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks \u2022 Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If clozapine tablets treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: \u2022 < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2022 \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 2 \u2022 Recommend hematology consultation \u2022 No dosage modification; continue treatment \u2022 Three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks \u2022 If ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u03bcL) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation \u2022 Daily \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 500/\u03bcL, obtain ANC three times weekly \u2022 Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets Treatment If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with: \u2022 Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. \u2022 Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL. If discontinuing clozapine tablets in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: \u2022 Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. \u2022 ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing clozapine tablets, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine Tablets Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine Tablets When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have interrupted clozapine tablets treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. \u2022 If two days of dosing is missed, resume clozapine tablets treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. \u2022 For longer interruptions, restart clozapine tablets treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial clozapine tablets treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of clozapine tablets-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Table 3. Clozapine Tablets Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the clozapine tablets dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

( 5.15 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating clozapine treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating clozapine treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout clozapine treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during clozapine treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to clozapine initiation. Clozapine initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in clozapine-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during clozapine treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Management of Clozapine-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during clozapine treatment: \u2022 Interrupt clozapine in those who develop a temperature of 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. \u2022 If the ANC is less than 1000/\u03bcL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]. In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with clozapine in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their clozapine-related severe neutropenia after stopping clozapine, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting clozapine (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than clozapine). Concomitant Use of Clozapine with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If clozapine is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy, and Mitral Valve Incompetence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Eosinophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] \u2022 Fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] \u2022 Anticholinergic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] \u2022 Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] \u2022 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) were: CNS reactions (sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor); cardiovascular reactions (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope); autonomic nervous system reactions (hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances); gastrointestinal reactions (constipation and nausea); and fever. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9. Common Adverse Reactions (\u22655%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine (N=126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N=142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u22652%) Reported in Clozapine-treated Patients (N=842) Across all Clozapine Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT TM Study) Body System Adverse Reaction* Clozapine N=842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 \u2020 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 \u2020 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary Abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry Mouth 6 Visual Disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 \u2020 Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine. Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT TM Study (\u226510% in the Clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition.

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] ."

There are reports of aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizure. Fatal overdoses have been reported with clozapine, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 g. 10.2 Management of Overdosage There is no available specific antidote to an overdose of clozapine. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac status and vital signs. Use general symptomatic and supportive measures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM ) , serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine versus olanzapine (*Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: \u2022 They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. \u2022 They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [ Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain) : Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms.

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) has caused severe neutropenia which is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ]. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT or during Clozapine ODT treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT . Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , and 2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT . Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine ODT is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia, which is associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal infections. Prior to initiating Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL (less than 1000/\u03bcL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during Clozapine ODT treatment ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 5.1 ). Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 5.4 ) Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.5 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine ODT is not approved for this condition. ( 5.6 )"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets (Clozapine ODT) is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment ( 1.1 ) Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Clozapine ODT) are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with their use, Clozapine ODT should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ]. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozapine ODT and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine ODT is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-\u00adexperiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of Clozapine ODT in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting oral dosage is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day at target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks ( 2.2 ) Subsequently may increase the dosage in increments up to 100 mg, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dosage is 450 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Administer with or without food. Clozapine ODT may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water. See additional administration instructions in full prescribing information ( 2.2 ). See dosage modification based on ANC results ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) See recommendations for discontinuing Clozapine ODT treatment ( 2.5 ), restarting Clozapine ODT after interrupting dosing ( 2.6 ), dosage modifications for drug interactions ( 2.7 ), dosage recommendations in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.8 ) in the full prescribing information. Tablets rapidly disintegrate after placement in the mouth and may be chewed if desired. No water is needed ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to Clozapine ODT Initiation Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration Recommended Dosage To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The recommended starting oral dosage of Clozapine ODT is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended Clozapine ODT oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily. Administration Instructions Clozapine ODT can be taken with or without food, may be allowed to disintegrate or chewed, and may be taken with or without water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Just prior to use, peel the foil from the blister and gently remove the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT). Do not push the ODT through the foil, because this could damage the ODT. After removing Clozapine ODT from the blister pack or bottle, immediately place in the mouth. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results Table 1 provides recommended Clozapine ODT dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Table 1: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing 1 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine ODT Treatment ANC Within Normal Range (\u2265 1500/\u03bcL) No dosage modification; continue treatment Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks Month 13 and thereafter: Every month If Clozapine ODT treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now has a normal ANC level) for: < 30 days, continue the previous ANC testing frequency \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients who initiate treatment Mild Neutropenia (ANC between 1000 to 1499/\u03bcL) 1 No dosage modification; continue treatment Three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL, recommend returning to the patient\u2019s last Normal Range ANC testing frequency Moderate Neutropenia (ANC between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 1 Interrupt treatment and recommend hematology consultation Resume treatment once ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL Daily Once ANC > 1000/\u03bcL, three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL, test weekly for 4 weeks. If ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL after monitoring weekly for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal Range ANC testing frequency Severe Neutropenia (ANC less than 500/\u03bcL) 1 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL, three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients who initiate treatment 2.4 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results for Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Table 2 provides recommended Clozapine ODT dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count). [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Table 2: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results and Frequency of ANC Testing in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia 1 1 Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) is also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count. 2 Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommended Dosage Modification Recommended Frequency of ANC Testing During Clozapine ODT Treatment in Patients with BEN ANC Within the Normal Range for Patients with BEN (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL ) No dosage modification; continue treatment Day 1 to Month 6: Weekly Month 7 to Month 12: Every 2 weeks Month 13 and thereafter: Monthly If Clozapine ODT treatment is reinitiated after a dosage interruption (e.g., patient had neutropenia which required dosage interruption and now their ANC (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline prior to treatment) for: < 30 days, continue previous ANC testing frequency \u2265 30 days, obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level between 500 to 999/\u03bcL) 2 Recommend hematology consultation No dosage modification; continue treatment Three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s ANC baseline, obtain ANC tests weekly for 4 weeks If ANC \u22651000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline after monitoring for 4 weeks, return to the patient\u2019s last Normal ANC Range testing frequency for patients with BEN. Severe Neutropenia in Patients with BEN (ANC level less than 500/\u03bcL) 2 Discontinue treatment and recommend hematology consultation Daily Once ANC \u2265 500/\u03bcL, obtain ANC three times weekly Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and \u2265 the patient\u2019s baseline, if the benefits outweigh the risks of restarting treatment, resume treatment and obtain ANC tests according to the frequency for patients with BEN who initiate treatment 2.5 Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT Treatment If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with: Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL. If discontinuing Clozapine ODT in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with: Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. When discontinuing Clozapine ODT, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 2.6 Restarting Clozapine ODT Treatment After Interrupting Clozapine ODT When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have interrupted Clozapine ODT treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If one day\u2019s dosage is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage. If two days of dosing is missed, resume Clozapine ODT treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage. For longer interruptions, restart Clozapine ODT treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial Clozapine ODT treatment. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of Clozapine ODT-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 3: Clozapine ODT Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Administer one third of the Clozapine ODT dosage. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dosage. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Consider increasing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary. 2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the Clozapine ODT dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe neutropenia: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.7 ) Eosinophilia : Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.8 ) QT Interval Prolongation : Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.9 ) Metabolic Changes : Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include ( 5.10 ): Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) : Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.11 ) Hepatotoxicity: Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.12 ). Fever : Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.14 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occurs. ( 5.15 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity : When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.15 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Clozapine has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/\u03bcL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of clozapine-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of Clozapine ODT treatment. The mechanism by which Clozapine ODT causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose-dependent. Consider a hematology consultation before initiating Clozapine ODT treatment or during treatment. ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL. Throughout VERZACLOZ treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during Clozapine ODT treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing Clozapine ODT-induced neutropenia. For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to Clozapine ODT initiation. Clozapine ODT initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in Clozapine ODT-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during Clozapine ODT treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Management of Clozapine ODT -Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever For patients who develop a fever during Clozapine ODT treatment: Interrupt Clozapine ODT in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 \u00b0F (38.5 \u00b0C) or greater and obtain an ANC level. If the ANC is less than 1000/\u03bcL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever. Restarting Clozapine ODT in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia Generally, do not rechallenge patients with Clozapine ODT in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their Clozapine ODT-related severe neutropenia after stopping Clozapine ODT, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting Clozapine ODT treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting Clozapine ODT (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than Clozapine ODT). Concomitant Use of Clozapine ODT with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia If Clozapine ODT is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Tables 1 and 2. 5.2 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Clozapine ODT treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum Clozapine ODT dosage is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting Clozapine ODT in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with Clozapine ODT, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.3 Falls Clozapine ODT may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment. 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate Clozapine ODT treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with Clozapine ODT use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. However, if the benefit of Clozapine ODT treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with Clozapine ODT in consultation with a cardiologist. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving Clozapine ODT who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with Clozapine ODT. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine ODT is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.7 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Prior to initiating Clozapine ODT, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in Clozapine ODT-treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.8 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during Clozapine ODT treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue Clozapine ODT immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to Clozapine ODT is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue Clozapine ODT. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of Clozapine ODT, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Clozapine ODT under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt Clozapine ODT therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing Clozapine ODT, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue Clozapine ODT if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue Clozapine ODT. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT. 5.10 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on Clozapine ODT should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using Clozapine ODT, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with Clozapine ODT. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.12 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to Clozapine ODT. 5.13 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self- limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. 5.14 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine ODT has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with Clozapine ODT can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine ODT can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Clozapine ODT does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe Clozapine ODT in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with Clozapine ODT despite the presence of the syndrome. TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.18 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that Clozapine ODT contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.70 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.40 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 5.61 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 8.42 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 11.23 mg phenylalanine. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for Clozapine ODT or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine ODT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT If abrupt discontinuation of Clozapine ODT is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u226510% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce Clozapine ODT dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing Clozapine ODT dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.7 , 5.15 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine ODT Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine ODT dose to one third of the original dose when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Clozapine ODT dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozapine ODT. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.15) ] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine ODT to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering Clozapine ODT with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactaton : Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including CLOZARIL, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Clozapine ODT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Clozapine ODT or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Clozapine ODT should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clozapine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with Clozapine ODT treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of Clozapine ODT, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ]. Carefully select Clozapine ODT doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine derivative, 8-chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-5 H -dibenzo [ b,e ] [1,4] diazepine. The structural formula is: Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (referred to as Clozapine ODT) are yellow to pale yellow, and are for oral administration. Each orally disintegrating tablet contains clozapine, USP, equivalent to 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg. The inactive ingredients include aspartame, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, polyvinyl acetate, povidone, powdarome peppermint premium, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate and yellow iron oxide. Clozapine ODT contains aspartame [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ]. Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.25 mg aspartame, thus, 0.70 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.5 mg aspartame, thus, 1.40 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 10 mg aspartame, thus, 5.61 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 15 mg aspartame, thus, 8.42 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 20 mg aspartame, thus, 11.23 mg phenylalanine. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of Clozapine ODT in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5\u00ad-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans Clozapine ODT (25 mg and 100 mg) is equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine oral solution. Clozapine ODT is bioequivalent to Clozaril (clozapine) tablets. Following a dosage of 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 413 ng/mL (range: 132 to 854 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.3 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 168 ng/mL (range: 45 to 574 ng/mL), after 100 mg b.i.d. dosing. A comparative bioequivalence/bioavailability study was conducted in 32 patients (with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) comparing Clozapine ODT 200 mg to 2 \u00d7 Clozapine ODT 100 mg (the approved reference product) under fasted conditions. The study also evaluated the effect of food and chewing on the pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg tablet. Under fasted conditions, the mean AUC ss and C min,ss of clozapine for the 200 mg oral disintegrating tablets were equivalent to those of the 2 x 100 mg tablets. The mean C max,ss of clozapine for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was 85% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT. This decrease in C max,ss for Clozapine ODT 200 mg is not clinically significant. For Clozapine ODT 200 mg, food significantly increased the C min,ss of clozapine by 21%. However, this increase is not clinically significant. The mean AUC ss and C max,ss of clozapine under fed conditions were equivalent to those under fasted conditions. Food delayed clozapine absorption by 1.5 hours, from a median T max of 2.5 hours under fasted conditions to 4 hours under fed conditions. The mean C max,ss of clozapine under chewed conditions for Clozapine ODT 200 mg was about 86% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine ODT under non-chewed conditions, while the AUC ss and C min,ss values were similar between the chewed and non-chewed conditions. In a food-effect study, a single dose of Clozapine ODT 12.5 mg was administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal. When Clozapine ODT were administered after a high-fat meal, the C max of both clozapine and its active metabolite, desmethylclozapine, were decreased by approximately 20%, compared to administration under fasting conditions, while the AUC values were unchanged. This decrease in C max is not clinically significant. Therefore, Clozapine ODT can be taken without regard to meals. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of Clozapine ODT demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine: A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 patients with schizophrenia who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethyl clozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline: In a study of patients with schizophrenia (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers: A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and Other Inflammatory Conditions: Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator- rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of six weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine (Clozaril \u00ae ) versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met one of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine treatment has caused severe neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500 / \u03bcL. Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine a baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )]. WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine can cause severe neutropenia, which can lead to serious and fatal infections. Patients initiating and continuing treatment with clozapine must have a baseline blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured before treatment initiation and regular ANC monitoring during treatment (2.1 , 5.1) .

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. (1.1 , 14.1) Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. (1.2 , 14.2) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.5 )]. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose: 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. (2.2) Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule. (2.2 , 5.3) Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated. (2.2) Target dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks. (2.2) Subsequent increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. (2.2) Maximum daily dose: 900 mg (2.2) 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population, and at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ]. 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient\u2019s last ANC: See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL and for BEN patients until their ANC is \u22651000/\u03bcL or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5\u00b0C or 101.3\u00b0F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If one day\u2019s dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing have been missed, resume dose at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate at a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well-tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 1. Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co-medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine tablets while taking a co-medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine tablets dose. Increase clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine tablets dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if the inducer is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Reduce clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. 2.7 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. (5.8) Eosinophilia : Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. (5.9) QT Interval Prolongation : Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). (5.10) Metabolic Changes : Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (5.11) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.11) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. (5.11) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) : Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. (5.12) Hepatotoxicity : Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur (5.13) . Fever : Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. (5.14) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. (5.15) Anticholinergic Toxicity : When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. (5.16 , 7.1) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. (5.17) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \u201csegs\u201d plus neutrophil \u201cbands\u201d). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, \u201csevere neutropenia\u201d replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than ( < ) 500/\u03bcL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (\u2265)1500/\u03bcL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient\u2019s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.

It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline \u22651000/\u00b5L) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/\u00b5L Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or \u2265 patient\u2019s known baseline Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient\u2019s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient\u2019s last \u201cNormal BEN Range\u201d ANC monitoring interval.

Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17) . Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/\u00b5L (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.8 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.9 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u00b5L, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.10 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.11 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.13 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.14 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.15 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9. Common Adverse Reactions (\u22655%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine (N=126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N=142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u22652%) Reported in Clozapine-treated Patients (N=842) Across all Clozapine Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT TM Study) Body System Adverse Reaction* Clozapine N=842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine.

This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT TM Study (\u226510% in the Clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). (2.6 , 7.1) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. (2.6 , 7.1) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. (2.6 , 7.1) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. (5.8 , 5.16 , 7.1) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.16) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure (8.1) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Hospice Patients For hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient\u2019s terminal illness."

Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] ."

There are reports of aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizure. Fatal overdoses have been reported with clozapine, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 g. 10.2 Management of Overdosage There is no available specific antidote to an overdose of clozapine. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac status and vital signs. Use general symptomatic and supportive measures. Consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of overdosage (1-800-222-1222)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine. Thus, clozapine may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was >600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was >1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u22643 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u226435, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p<0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine versus olanzapine (*Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: \u2022 Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.12 , 5.14) ] . Inform patients and caregivers clozapine is available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows: Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months. An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy, An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy. Clozapine is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product ( www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope : Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administraton (2.2 , (2.6) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. \u2022 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. \u2022 Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain) : Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . \u2022 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . \u2022 Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine for more than 2 days, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ]. \u2022 Pregnancy: Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with clozapine.

Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets a baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is dose - related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatalmyocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine tablets-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine tablets are not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine tablets can cause severe neutropenia, which can lead to serious and fatal infections. Patients initiating and continuing treatment with clozapine tablets must have a baseline blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured before treatment initiation and regular ANC monitoring during treatment ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS ( 5.2 ). Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.5 , 5.3 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.6 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine tablets are not approved for this condition. ( 5.7 )"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.1 , 14.1 ) Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.2 , 14.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.5) ] . The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose: 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated. ( 2.2 ) Target dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Subsequent increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dose: 900 mg ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population, and at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ] . 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient\u2019s last ANC: See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine tablets therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is \u2265 1500/\u03bcL and for BEN patients until their ANC is \u2265 1000/\u03bcL or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5\u00b0C or 101.3\u00b0F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If one day\u2019s dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing have been missed, resume dose at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate at a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well-tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant Use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Table 1. Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co-medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine tablets while taking a co-medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine tablets dose. Increase clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine tablets dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if the inducer is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Reduce clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. 2.7 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] ."

Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.13 ). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.14 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.15 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.16 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.17 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \u201csegs\u201d plus neutrophil \u201cbands\u201d). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, \u201csevere neutropenia\u201d replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/\u03bcL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine tablets and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine tablets cause neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (\u2265) 1500/\u03bcL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient\u2019s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2.

It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine tablets treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine tablets management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine tablets treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3. Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline \u2265 1000/\u00b5L) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/\u00b5L Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or \u2265 patient\u2019s known baseline Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient\u2019s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient\u2019s last \u201cNormal BEN Range\u201d ANC monitoring interval.

Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/\u00b5L, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17) . Rechallenge After an ANC Less Than 500/\u00b5L (Severe Neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine tablets-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine tablets). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine tablets rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine Tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine tablets treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine tablets are used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablets Further information is available at www.clozapineREMS.com or 1-888-586-0758. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrence, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist. Myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently present within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine tablets. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine tablets, mitral valve incompetence has been reported. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.8 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets, primarily due to their potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2) ] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Prior to initiating clozapine tablets, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.9 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine tablets-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.10 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QT c interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.11 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine tablets group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine tablets doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine. Table 4.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine tablets group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine tablets group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine tablets dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine tablets and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine tablets, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine tablets monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.13 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.14 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 5.15 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets have potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10) ] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets do not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy, and Mitral Valve Incompetence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Eosinophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] Anticholinergic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ] Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) were: CNS reactions (sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor); cardiovascular reactions (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope); autonomic nervous system reactions (hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances); gastrointestinal reactions (constipation and nausea); and fever. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) across clozapine tablets clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in clozapine tablets-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 9. Common Adverse Reactions (\u2265 5%) in the 6-Week, Randomized, Chlorpromazine-Controlled Trial in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Adverse Reaction Clozapine Tablets (N = 126) (%) Chlorpromazine (N = 142) (%) Sedation 21 13 Tachycardia 17 11 Constipation 16 12 Dizziness 14 16 Hypotension 13 38 Fever (hyperthermia) 13 4 Hypersalivation 13 1 Hypertension 12 5 Headache 10 10 Nausea/vomiting 10 12 Dry mouth 5 20 Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in clozapine tablets-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine tablets studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 10. Adverse Reactions (\u2265 2%) Reported in Clozapine Tablets-Treated Patients (N = 842) Across all Clozapine Tablets Studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT\u2122 Study) Body System Adverse Reaction Rate based on population of approximately 1700 exposed during premarket clinical evaluation of clozapine tablets. Clozapine Tablets N = 842 Percentage of Patients Central Nervous System Drowsiness/Sedation 39 Dizziness/Vertigo 19 Headache 7 Tremor 6 Syncope 6 Disturbed Sleep/Nightmares 4 Restlessness 4 Hypokinesia/Akinesia 4 Agitation 4 Seizures (convulsions) 3 Rigidity 3 Akathisia 3 Confusion 3 Fatigue 2 Insomnia 2 Cardiovascular Tachycardia 25 Hypotension 9 Hypertension 4 Gastrointestinal Constipation 14 Nausea 5 Abdominal Discomfort/Heartburn 4 Nausea/Vomiting 3 Vomiting 3 Diarrhea 2 Urogenital Urinary Abnormalities 2 Autonomic Nervous System Salivation 31 Sweating 6 Dry Mouth 6 Visual Disturbances 5 Skin Rash 2 Hemic/Lymphatic Leukopenia/Decreased WBC/Neutropenia 3 Miscellaneous Fever 5 Weight Gain 4 Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10% of the clozapine tablets or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine tablets relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine Tablets or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u2265 10% in the Clozapine Tablets or Olanzapine Group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine Tablets N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, pericarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, fecal incontinence, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine tablets dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.8 , 5.16 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine tablets with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.16) ]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published epidemiologic studies over decades of use with clozapine during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets, during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when clozapine was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis, or to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation, at doses up to approximately 0.4 and 0.9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day, for rats and rabbits respectively, based on mg/m2 body surface area ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who have been exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m2 body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Clozapine is present in human milk. There is one case report of sedation and a report of agranulocytosis in an infant exposed to clozapine through human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). There is no information on the effects of clozapine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for clozapine tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clozapine tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clozapine tablets should be monitored for excess sedation and neutropenia. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine tablets treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine tablets, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] . Carefully select clozapine tablets doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Hospice Patients For hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient\u2019s terminal illness."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine tablets 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine tablets. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady-state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady-state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n = 14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%-10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine tablets. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady-state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady-state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n = 14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%-10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N = 305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (N = 268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine tablets (N = 126) or chlorpromazine (N = 142). The maximum daily clozapine tablets dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of \u2264 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of \u2264 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine tablets group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine tablets group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p < 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine tablets versus olanzapine (Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200-900 mg/day for clozapine tablets and 5-20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine tablets or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18-69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine tablets had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine tablets in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine tablets over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine tablets patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine tablets 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine tablets about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine tablets therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.12 , 5.14) ] . Inform patients and caregivers clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows: Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months. An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy. An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy. Clozapine tablets are available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product (www.clozapineREMS.com or 1-888-586-0758) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ] . Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Seizures: Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine tablets treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications: Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . QT Interval Prolongation: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Weight Gain): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . Missed Doses and Re-Initiating Treatment: Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for more than 2 days, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ] . Pregnancy: Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with clozapine tablets. Advise patients that clozapine tablets may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to clozapine tablets during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Lactation: Advise breastfeeding women using clozapine tablets to monitor infants for excess sedation and to seek medical care if they notice this sign. Inform breastfeeding women using clozapine tablets that their healthcare provider will monitor infants for neutropenia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ]. Concomitant Medication: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .

      "WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Severe Neutropenia Clozapine tablets treatment has caused severe neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500 / \u03bcL. Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets a baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u03bcL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/\u03bcL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Seizures Seizures have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) ] . Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine tablets-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine tablets are not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe Neutropenia: Clozapine tablets can cause severe neutropenia, which can lead to serious and fatal infections. Patients initiating and continuing treatment with clozapine tablets must have a baseline blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured before treatment initiation and regular ANC monitoring during treatment. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS. ( 5.2 ) Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope: Risk is dose-related. Starting dose is 12.5 mg. Titrate gradually and use divided dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.5 , 5.3 ) Seizure: Risk is dose-related. Titrate gradually and use divided doses. Use with caution in patients with history of seizure or risk factors for seizure. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence: Can be fatal. Discontinue and obtain cardiac evaluation if findings suggest these cardiac reactions. ( 5.6 ) Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Clozapine tablets are not approved for this condition. ( 5.7 )"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clozapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.1 , 14.1 ) Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study. ( 1.2 , 14.2 ) 1.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, clozapine tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.5 )] . The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Clozapine tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death. The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT\u2122 trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose: 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Use cautious titration and divided dosage schedule. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Titration: increase the total daily dosage in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated. ( 2.2 ) Target dose: 300 mg to 450 mg per day, in divided doses, by the end of 2 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Subsequent increases: increase in increments of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dose: 900 mg. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/\u00b5L for the general population, and at least 1000/\u00b5L for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Dosing Information The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient\u2019s last ANC: See Table 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia. Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine tablets therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia. For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is \u22651500/\u03bcL and for BEN patients until their ANC is \u22651000/\u03bcL or above their baseline. Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5\u00b0C or 101.3\u00b0F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If one day\u2019s dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing have been missed, resume dose at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate at a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well-tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment. 2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) ( Table 1 ) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Table 1. Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications Co-medications Scenarios Initiating clozapine tablets while taking a co-medication Adding a co-medication while taking clozapine tablets Discontinuing a co-medication while continuing clozapine tablets Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Use one-third of the clozapine tablets dose. Increase clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for lack of effectiveness. Consider increasing clozapine tablets dose if necessary. CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use is not recommended. However, if the inducer is necessary, it may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose. Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Reduce clozapine tablets dose based on clinical response. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers Monitor for decreased effectiveness. Consider increasing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. Monitor for adverse reactions. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose if necessary. 2.7 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. If constipation is identified, close monitoring and prompt treatment is advised. ( 5.8 ) Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( 5.9 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( 5.10 ) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. ( 5.11 ) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( 5.11 ) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. ( 5.11 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( 5.12 ) Hepatotoxicity : Can be fatal. Monitor for hepatotoxicity. Discontinue treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other symptoms occur ( 5.13 ). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. ( 5.14 ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. ( 5.15 ) Anticholinergic Toxicity: When possible, avoid use with other anticholinergic drugs and use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. ( 5.16 , 7.1 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( 5.17 ) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil \u201csegs\u201d plus neutrophil \u201cbands\u201d) . Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Table 2 and 3 ). To improve and standardize understanding, \u201csevere neutropenia\u201d replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/\u03bcL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine tablets and are associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine tablets cause neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2 ) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (\u2265) 1500/\u03bcL are considered within normal range ( Table 2 ) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient\u2019s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/\u03bcL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (\u22651500/\u03bcL) Initiate treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/\u03bcL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u00b5L with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L, return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/\u03bcL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia Resume treatment once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L Daily until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal Range\" ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/\u03bcL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L Clozapine Tablets Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3 ) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than \u201cstandard\u201d laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine tablets treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine tablets management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine tablets treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline \u2265 1000/\u03bcL) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted < 30 days, continue monitoring as before \u2265 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/\u03bcL Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/\u03bcL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or \u2265 patient's known baseline Once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L, or at patient's known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last \"Normal BEN Range\" ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/\u03bcL Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC \u2265 500/\u00b5L, then Three times weekly until ANC \u2265 patient's baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under \"Normal Range\" monitoring once ANC \u2265 1000/\u00b5L or at patient's baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt clozapine tablets as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/\u03bcL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Table 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17 ). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/\u03bcL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine tablets-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine tablets). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Table 2 and 3 , the patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine tablets rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine Tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine tablets-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine tablets treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine tablets are used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Table 2 and 3 . Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablets Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine tablets, the dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Falls Clozapine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.5 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.6 Myocarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine tablets who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine tablets. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. In patients who are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy while taking clozapine tablets mitral valve incompetence has been reported. These cases reported either mild or moderate mitral regurgitation on two-dimensional echocardiography. In patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, consider a 2D-echo Doppler examination to identify mitral valve incompetence. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.8 Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.2 )] . These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Prior to initiating clozapine tablets, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine tablets treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients. 5.9 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/\u03bcL, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine tablets-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.10 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.11 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine tablets group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group ( Table 4 ). The clozapine tablets doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (\u2265 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine tablets group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine tablets group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group ( Table 5 ). In addition, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6 . The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine tablets dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine tablets and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine tablets, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine tablets monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.13 Hepatotoxicity Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine. 5.14 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . 5.15 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) across clozapine tablets clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) in clozapine tablets-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Table 11 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u226510% of the clozapine tablets or olanzapine group) in the InterSePT\u2122 Study. This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine tablets relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine Tablets or Olanzapine in the InterSePT\u2122 Study (\u226510% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine Tablets N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48 6 Somnolence 46 25 Weight increased 31 56 Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27 12 Constipation 25 10 Insomnia 20 33 Nausea 17 10 Vomiting 17 9 Dyspepsia 14 8 Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, restless leg syndrome and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, mitral valve incompetence associated with clozapine-related cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis, megacolon, and intestinal ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration or necrosis. Hepatobiliary System Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure. Immune System Disorders Angioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Urogenital System Acute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, renal failure, and retrograde ejaculation. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation disorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders Myasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Respiratory System Aspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sleep apnea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Mild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep-vein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Vision Disorders Narrow-angle glaucoma. Miscellaneous Creatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, polyserositis, and weight loss."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Reduce clozapine tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine tablets dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use may increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity. ( 5.8 , 5.16 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine tablets with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8, 5.16 )]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or discontinue nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, clozapine tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Clinical Considerations Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data In embryo fetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Clozapine tablets is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clozapine tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine tablets treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine tablets, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . Carefully select clozapine tablets doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] . 8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Hospice Patients For hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient\u2019s terminal illness."

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, clozapine tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Clinical Considerations Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data In embryo fetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or body weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine tablets to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine tablets. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine tablets treatment [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects. Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine tablets, such as urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . Carefully select clozapine tablets doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT 2A ) receptors. Clozapine tablets also act as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H 1 (K i 1.1 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 1A (K i 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT 6 (K i 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2A (K i 5.4 nM), muscarinic M 1 (K i 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT 7 (K i 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT 2C (K i 9.4 nM), dopamine D 4 (K i 24 nM), adrenergic \u03b1 2A (K i 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT 3 (K i 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT 1A (K i 120 nM), dopamine D 2 (K i 160 nM), dopamine D 1 (K i 270 nM), dopamine D 5 (K i 454 nM), and dopamine D 3 (K i 555 nM). Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation. Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Following oral administration of clozapine tablets 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL), after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of clozapine tablets. Thus, clozapine tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Metabolism and Excretion Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N -oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N -oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing. A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Fluvoxamine A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine N -oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady-state concentrations. Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline In a study of schizophrenic patients (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Specific Population Studies Renal or Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses. CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers A subset (3%\u201310%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. Patients with Pneumonia and other Inflammatory Conditions Published case reports describe examples where pneumonia or other inflammatory conditions may increase clozapine concentrations. The clinical significance, the impact of treatments to modulate this inflammation, and mechanism of this potential increase in clozapine concentrations have not been fully characterized but may involve reduced cytochrome P450 1A2 activity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia The efficacy of clozapine tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions \u2013 Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill). In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine tablets (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine tablets dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was > 600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was > 1200 mg. The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of < 3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of < 35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of 6 weeks, 30% of the clozapine tablets group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine tablets group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p< 0.001 in each analysis). 14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder The effectiveness of clozapine tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT\u2122, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine tablets versus olanzapine ( * Zyprexa \u00ae , a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria: They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation. Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200\u2013 900 mg/day for clozapine tablets and 5\u201320 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine tablets or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group. The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by \u201cmuch worsening\u201d or \u201cvery much worsening\u201d from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data. A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18\u201369). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of \u201cother\u201d races. Patients treated with clozapine tablets had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine tablets in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine tablets over olanzapine. The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine tablets patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine tablets 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% ( Figure 1 ).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers: Severe Neutropenia: Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine tablets about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine tablets therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), 5.11 , 5.14 )] . Inform patients and caregivers clozapine tablets are available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows: Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months. An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy, An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy. Clozapine tablets are available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product ( www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope : Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Instruct them to strictly follow the clinician\u2019s instructions for dosage and administration [ see Dosage and Administraton ( 2.2, 2.5 ) ]. Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Seizures : Inform patients and caregivers about the significant risk of seizure during clozapine tablets treatment. Caution them about driving and any other potentially hazardous activity while taking clozapine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications : Educate patients and caregivers on the risks, prevention and treatment of clozapine-induced constipation, including medications to avoid when possible (e.g., drugs with anticholinergic activity). Encourage appropriate hydration, physical activity, and fiber intake and emphasize that prompt attention and treatment to the development of constipation or other gastrointestinal symptoms is critical in preventing severe complications. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms of constipation (e.g., difficulty passing stools, incomplete passage of stool, decreased bowel movement frequency) or other symptoms associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility (e.g., nausea, abdominal distension or pain, vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . QT Interval Prolongation : Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine tablets with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine tablets before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain ): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance : Because clozapine tablets may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] . Missed Doses and Re-initiating Treatment : Inform patients and caregivers that if the patient misses taking clozapine tablets for more than 2 days, they should not restart their medication at the same dosage but should contact their physician for dosing instructions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 )] . Pregnancy : Patients and caregivers should notify the clinician if the patient becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Nursing : Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should not breastfeed an infant if they are taking clozapine tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Concomitant Medication : Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs; there is a potential for significant drug-drug interactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .
